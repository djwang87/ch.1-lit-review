  abstract = {Introduced into Australia in 1935, the cane toad (Chaunus [Bufo] marinus) threatens native vertebrate predators. However, there have been few rigorous quantitative studies on species threatened by this toxic invasive species. This study examines the changes in abundance and proportion of sites occupied by Merten's water monitor (Varanus mertensi) at a site in the Northern Territory following invasion by cane toads. The study was located at Manton Dam Recreation Area, 70 km south of Darwin, and ran for 18 months. Cane toads were first detected at the study site in February 2005, three months after the first survey, and their abundance remained low until February 2006, when an increase was observed. The abundance of V. mertensi declined substantially 8 months after the arrival of cane toads and remained low. The probability of detection of V. mertensi varied considerably within and among surveys, and was higher in the wet season surveys. The proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi at the start of the study was 0.95 {$\pm$} 0.03. Site occupancy remained high for 6 months after the arrival of cane toads, but declined gradually to a low of 0.15 {$\pm$} 0.16 within 12 months. There has been demonstrable change in the abundance and proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi following the colonisation of cane toads, but the population has been able to persist. Monitoring of populations impacted by cane toads may provide unique opportunities to understand processes underlying local extinction and colonisation of native predators following the impact of invasive species.},

  abstract = {Data loggers were utilized to record depth, temperature, biaxial motion and swimming speed for female green turtles Chelonia mydas between nesting events in Thailand. The present study demonstrated clear alternations in swimming effort with depth. Both resident and maximum dive depths significantly affected flipper beat frequency, suggesting that turtles change flipper beat frequency with current buoyancy in ways similar to other diving mammals and birds. Body angles became steepest during the initial phases of descent and ascent, but were {$<$} 60\textdegree. Swimming speeds were related to flipper beat frequency and current buoyancy. Swimming speeds based on the dominant stroke frequency during the inter-nesting period (0.18 to 0.21 Hz) were estimated at 0.52 to 0.60 curved carapace lengths s\textendash 1. These values are similar to the modal speeds of the leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea and the mean speeds during the initial descent of the loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta. We calculated the dynamic body acceleration (DBA) as the index of activity during the descent and ascent phases and found a relationship between maximum dive depth and DBA. Although active stroking during deeper dives may result in a shorter dive duration, daytime dives (ca. 16 to 26 m) were deeper than those observed during the night (ca. 9 to 13 m). This result suggests a beneficial reproductive strategy for females that involves changes in vertical space, for example, to obtain refuge from energy-consuming encounters with males or predators.},

  abstract = {The mesopredator release hypothesis and theory of intra-guild predation emphasize that interactions between coexisting predators may be strong and important to population and community dynamics. This is because predators not only compete for food resources but large predators frequently kill smaller predators and suppress their abundances. Across Australia suppression of native and introduced carnivores (e.g., dingoes [Canis lupis dingo] and red foxes [Vulpes vulpes]) using poison baits containing sodium fluoroacetate (``1080'') is likely to disrupt predator-prey and competitive interactions that follows the manipulation of top predator abundances. Currently there is little understanding of how top predator suppression affects Australia's predator guilds and especially the large and common varanid lizards. However, given the importance, and even potential negative consequences, of mesopredator release, evaluation of the effects of top predator suppression on native predators is vital. Here we investigated the effects that a large scale red fox (5-7 kg), suppression program had on a large predatory lizard, the Lace monitor (Varanus varius, 4-7 kg). We evaluated the effects of fox suppression on proxies of V. varius population status using count surveys in replicated poison baited and non-poison baited control areas. We compared the effects of fox baiting on the maximum body size and body condition of lizards, and their sex ratio, to infer further consequences of potential competition between foxes and V. varius. We found increased population counts and higher site occupancy of V. varius in poisonbaited areas relative to control areas. Lizards in fox baited sites were also in better body condition, but neither maximum body size nor sex ratio differed between baited and control treatment areas. Our study shows that: 1) Fox management, via 1080 baiting, can benefit V. varius; 2) V. varius functions as a mesopredator in the presence of foxes; and 3) mesopredator release is not restricted to interactions between vertebrate species of the same order.},

  abstract = {Nonindigenous species affect native ecosystems, communities, and populations in myriad ways, from plants (and a few animals) that overgrow entire communities, to plants and animals that hybridize individual native species to a sort of genetic extinction. Further, nonindigenous species sometimes interact to worsen each other's impact. These impacts are commonly seen in national parks throughout the United States. The key policy change required to alleviate this threat is a shift from blacklists of prohibited species and a presumption of harmlessness to combinations of white and blacklists and a presumption that any species may be damaging. This new guiding philosophy must be inculcated at international and national levels, which will not be easy during a period when free trade is seen as an unmitigated blessing. Within the United States, enhanced cooperation and coordination will be required among all parties (i.e., federal, state, and local agencies as well as private entities) charged with managing invasions. Internationally, the key forum is the World Trade Organization. Various management tools available to combat nonindigenous species have produced some striking successes, but new research could improve their effectiveness and reliability. There is a particular need for research on ecosystem management to control introduced species. In the face of the increasingly publicized onslaught of invaders, there is a widespread tendency to view increased biotic homogenization as inevitable. However, advances in both policy and technology could greatly slow this process and perhaps (in concert with restoration measures) even reverse it. The necessary pressure and resources to effect these changes must come from an increasingly alarmed and vocal public.},
