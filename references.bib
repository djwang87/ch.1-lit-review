  abstract = {Introduced into Australia in 1935, the cane toad (Chaunus [Bufo] marinus) threatens native vertebrate predators. However, there have been few rigorous quantitative studies on species threatened by this toxic invasive species. This study examines the changes in abundance and proportion of sites occupied by Merten's water monitor (Varanus mertensi) at a site in the Northern Territory following invasion by cane toads. The study was located at Manton Dam Recreation Area, 70 km south of Darwin, and ran for 18 months. Cane toads were first detected at the study site in February 2005, three months after the first survey, and their abundance remained low until February 2006, when an increase was observed. The abundance of V. mertensi declined substantially 8 months after the arrival of cane toads and remained low. The probability of detection of V. mertensi varied considerably within and among surveys, and was higher in the wet season surveys. The proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi at the start of the study was 0.95 {$\pm$} 0.03. Site occupancy remained high for 6 months after the arrival of cane toads, but declined gradually to a low of 0.15 {$\pm$} 0.16 within 12 months. There has been demonstrable change in the abundance and proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi following the colonisation of cane toads, but the population has been able to persist. Monitoring of populations impacted by cane toads may provide unique opportunities to understand processes underlying local extinction and colonisation of native predators following the impact of invasive species.},

  abstract = {Data loggers were utilized to record depth, temperature, biaxial motion and swimming speed for female green turtles Chelonia mydas between nesting events in Thailand. The present study demonstrated clear alternations in swimming effort with depth. Both resident and maximum dive depths significantly affected flipper beat frequency, suggesting that turtles change flipper beat frequency with current buoyancy in ways similar to other diving mammals and birds. Body angles became steepest during the initial phases of descent and ascent, but were {$<$} 60\textdegree. Swimming speeds were related to flipper beat frequency and current buoyancy. Swimming speeds based on the dominant stroke frequency during the inter-nesting period (0.18 to 0.21 Hz) were estimated at 0.52 to 0.60 curved carapace lengths s\textendash 1. These values are similar to the modal speeds of the leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea and the mean speeds during the initial descent of the loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta. We calculated the dynamic body acceleration (DBA) as the index of activity during the descent and ascent phases and found a relationship between maximum dive depth and DBA. Although active stroking during deeper dives may result in a shorter dive duration, daytime dives (ca. 16 to 26 m) were deeper than those observed during the night (ca. 9 to 13 m). This result suggests a beneficial reproductive strategy for females that involves changes in vertical space, for example, to obtain refuge from energy-consuming encounters with males or predators.},
