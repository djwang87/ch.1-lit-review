abstract = {Red foxes Vulpes vulpes were observed foraging in sites occupied by nesting waders and waterfowl in the Lower Derwent Valley in northern England. The data obtained were used to parameterise an individual-based simulation model of fox search behaviour, which was used to explore the sensitivity of nest encounter rates to changes of search area between 1 and 10 ha. The model predicted that nests in larger patches will have a much greater chance of surviving predation than nests in smaller patches for realistic foraging effort, assuming that the search time is equal in all patches. This qualitative result remained the same for a range of realistic nest detection efficiencies and movement parameters. Patch size was also shown to be important when the assumption of equal search effort between patches was relaxed. When foxes were assumed to search systematically in a zigzag path along strip habitats, nest predation risk was shown to be sensitive to changes in habitat width of a few metres, provided the habitats were long enough (more than ∼8 km). The implications for predation management and new research on fox behaviour are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although conspicuous visual sexual signals, such as bright colors, in males serve to attract females in numerous species, they may also attract the attention of potential predators and thus may be costly in terms of increasing individual risk of mortality to predation. Most models of the evolution of extravagant male sexual traits and female preferences for them assume that the sexually preferred male trait is costly to produce and maintain. However, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence for direct fitness costs associated with sexually selected visual traits that enhance male mating success. In the present study, we report a direct fitness cost for sexually selected, bright body-color patterns in males in the form of an associated greater risk of mortality to predation. By using the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and the blue acara cichlid fish (Aequidens pulcher) as a model prey–predator system, we demonstrate experimentally that individual cichlids preferentially and consistently approached, attacked, and captured the more brightly colored of two size-matched male guppies presented simultaneously in staged encounters. This resulted in the brightly colored male incurring, on average, a significantly higher risk of mortality given an encounter with the predator than with the drabber male in matched pairs. Our results constitute strong behavioral evidence for a direct viability cost associated with bright coloration in male guppies, and they corroborate the generally accepted paradigm that directional predation by visual fish predators against brightly colored, adult male guppies underlies the evolution of the known divergent color patterns in natural guppy populations that experience different intensities of predation. The viability cost associated with bright conspicuous coloration in male guppies potentially reinforces for females the reliability of this sexually selected trait as an indicator trait of male quality.},

abstract = {Large carnivores are frequently presented as saviours of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning through their creation of trophic cascades, an idea largely based on studies coming primarily out of relatively natural landscapes. However, in large parts of the world, particularly in Europe, large carnivores live in and are returning to strongly human-modified ecosystems. At present,we lack a coherent framework to predict the effects of large carnivores in these anthropogenic landscapes. We review how human actions influence the ecological roles of large carnivores by affecting their density or behaviour or those of mesopredators or prey species. We argue that the potential for density-mediated trophic cascades in anthropogenic landscapes is limited to unproductive areas where even low carnivore numbers may impact prey densities or to the limited parts of the landscape where carnivores are allowed to reach ecologically functional densities. The potential for behaviourally mediated trophic cascades may be larger and more widespread, because even low carnivore densities affect prey behaviour. We conclude that predator–prey interactions in anthropogenic landscapes will be highly context-dependent and human actions will often attenuate the ecological effects of large carnivores. We highlight the knowledge gaps and outline a new research avenue to study the role of carnivores in anthropogenic landscapes.},

abstract = {We studied the simultaneous activity patterns of a breeding wolf, Canis lupus, pair and five adult moose, Alces alces, cows from April to November 2004 in a wolf territory in southeastern Norway. All study animals were GPS collared, and we used a total of 8297 fixes to analyse their temporal activity patterns. We examined the daily activity rhythm of the two species and how this varied seasonally through the study period, and investigated the association in activity patterns between the two species. Wolf activity peaked at dawn. The distance moved per time unit and the linearity of the movement were higher in wolves than in moose, but both species showed a decrease in these variables in June, coinciding with the denning and calving seasons. With the exception of the summer months when the activity of wolves and moose was limited by the raising of offspring, we found no correlation between the temporal activities of the two species. Hence, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the wolves and moose in Scandinavia have adjusted to each other's activity patterns. We discuss the results in light of the relative density of the two species and the intensive human harvest of moose, and hypothesize that synchronicity of predator-prey activity patterns may be ratio dependent. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Green iguanas are very favoured by the pet trade (approximately one million are imported into the USA annually, and nearly an equal number are imported into and distributed to the UK, continental Europe, and Asia). Even with trade, green iguanas are still relatively nonendangered over much of their range because captive breeding is often effective.

abstract = {Most mammalian populations suffer from natural or human-induced disturbances; populations are no longer at the equilibrium (i.e., at stable [st]age distribution) and exhibit transient dynamics. From a literature survey, we studied patterns of transient dynamics for mammalian species spanning a large range of life-history tactics and population growth rates. For each population, we built an age-structured matrix and calculated six metrics of transient dynamics. After controlling for possible confounding effects of the phylogenetic relatedness among species using a phylogenetic principal component analysis and phylogenetic generalized least squares models, we found that short-term demographic responses of mammalian populations to disturbance are shaped by generation time and growth rate. Species with a slow pace of life (i.e., species with a late maturity, a low fecundity, and a long life span) displayed decreases in population size after a disturbance, whereas fast-living species increased in population size. The magnitude of short-term variation in population size increased with asymptotic population growth, being buffered in slow-growing species (i.e., species with a low population growth rate) but large in fast-growing species. By demonstrating direct links between transient dynamics, life history (generation time), and ecology (demographic regime), our comparative analysis of transient dynamics clearly improves our understanding of population dynamics in variable environments and has clear implications for future studies of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. As most populations in the wild are not at equilibrium, we recommend that analyses of transient dynamics be performed when studying population dynamics in variable environments.},

abstract = {There has long been interest in the influence of predators on prey populations, although most predator-prey studies have focused on prey species that are targets of directed predator searching. Conversely, few have addressed depredation that occurs after incidental encounters with predators. We tested two predictions stemming from the hypothesis that nest predation on two sympatric freshwater turtle species whose nests are differentially prone to opportunistic detection-painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) and snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina)-is incidental: (1) predation rates should be density independent, and (2) individual predators should not alter their foraging behavior after encountering nests. After monitoring nest survival and predator behavior following nest depredation over 2 years, we confirmed that predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor), the primary nest predators in our study area, matched both predictions. Furthermore, cryptic C. picta nests were victimized with lower frequency than more detectable C. serpentina nests, and nests of both species were more vulnerable in human-modified areas where opportunistic nest discovery is facilitated. Despite apparently being incidental, predation on nests of both species was intensive (57{\%} for painted turtles, 84{\%} for snapping turtles), and most depredations occurred within 1 day of nest establishment. By implication, predation need not be directed to affect prey demography, and factors influencing prey crypsis are drivers of the impact of incidental predation on prey. Our results also imply that efforts to conserve imperiled turtle populations in human-modified landscapes should include restoration of undisturbed conditions that are less likely to expose nests to incidental predators.},

abstract = {The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is a focal species in game management, epidemiology and ornithology, but comparably little research has focused on the ecology of the migration seasons. We studied habitat use, time-budgets, home-range sizes, habitat selection, and movements based on spatial data collected with GPS devices attached to wild mallards trapped at an autumn stopover site in the Northwest European flyway. Sixteen individuals (13 males, 3 females) were followed for 15-38 days in October to December 2010. Forty-nine percent (SD = 8.4{\%}) of the ducks' total time, and 85{\%} of the day-time (SD = 28.3{\%}), was spent at sheltered reefs and bays on the coast. Two ducks used ponds, rather than coast, as day-roosts instead. Mallards spent most of the night (76{\%} of total time, SD = 15.8{\%}) on wetlands, mainly on alvar steppe, or in various flooded areas (e.g. coastal meadows). Crop fields with maize were also selectively utilized. Movements between roosting and foraging areas mainly took place at dawn and dusk, and the home-ranges observed in our study are among the largest ever documented for mallards (mean = 6,859 ha; SD = 5,872 ha). This study provides insights into relatively unknown aspects of mallard ecology. The fact that autumn-staging migratory mallards have a well-developed diel activity pattern tightly linked to the use of specific habitats has implications for wetland management, hunting and conservation, as well as for the epidemiology of diseases shared between wildlife and domestic animals.},

We review published literature to evaluate the incidence of predation in crocodilian populations, and the implications of that mortality for crocodilian life-history evolution. Presumably because predation is size-dependent, small-bodied crocodilian taxa appear to be more vulnerable to predation (across a range of life stages) than are larger-bodied species. Several features of crocodilian biology likely reflect adaptations to reducing vulnerability to predation. For example, the threat of predation may have influenced the evolution of traits such as nest-site selection, maternal care of eggs and hatchlings, cre`che behavior in hatchlings, and cryptic coloration and patterning. Even for such large and superficially invulnerable taxa such as crocodilians, the avoidance of predation appears to have been a significant selective force on behavior, morphology, and ecology.},

Discrete choice models calculate the probability of an indi- vidual selecting a resource as a function of the attributes of that resource and all other available resources. The data for these attributes may be continuous or categorical. When availability is the same for all individuals and only two resources are available, the mul- tinomial logit discrete choice model reduces to the logistic model. Discrete choice models and advances in GIS technology give the researcher flexibility in defining resource avail- ability separately for each individual over time and space. The output of the discrete choice approach also provides managers with a tool to explore the effects of potential management actions and provides researchers with new hypotheses deserving of further investigation. To illustrate the application of discrete choice models to resource selection studies, we present a case study of summer diurnal bed site selection by elk (Cervus elaphus) in Custer State Park, South Dakota, United States. The results demonstrate the importance of factors relating to thermal regulation, hiding cover, and potentially forage, in elk bed site selection in this region.},

abstract = {Domestic dog is the most successful invasive mammalian predator species, and reducing its ecological impacts on wildlife is a central conservation goal globally. Free-ranging dogs can negatively interact with wildlife at multiple levels, posing issues for biodiversity conservation in tropical forests, especially in fragmented Atlantic Forest. To optimize future control programs, it is necessary to identify the main factors influencing their habitat use, particularly in natural reserves. We combined camera trapping data and occupancy models to characterize habitat use of dogs in six Atlantic Forest protected areas (134-36,000 ha). Our results show that dogs were more likely to use sites ({\^{}} {\'{E}} ! 0.90) having higher housing density (!4.00 houses/km 2) or higher proportion of croplands and pasture (!75{\%}) relative to sites with no houses ({\^{}} {\'{E}} ¼ 0.23 AE 0.10) or lower proportion of croplands and pasture ({\^{}} {\'{E}} ¼ 0.34 AE 0.08). In addition, dogs had higher detection probability at camera locations on unpaved roads ({\^{}} p ¼ 0.33 AE 0.05) relative to off-road sites ({\^{}} p ¼ 0.18 AE 0.04), and in small protected areas with high housing density, that is, more disturbed sites, dogs had higher detection probabilities. Our findings indicate that the probability of dogs using a site within protected area is mainly driven by type and intensity of human activity in the surroundings. Given the urgent need to control free-ranging dogs within protected areas, we strongly recommend that managers target sites/areas within and near protected areas that have a rural housing density ! 4.00 houses/km 2 or higher proportion of croplands and pasture (!75{\%}).},

abstract = {Remote measurement of the physiology, behaviour and energetic status of free-living animals is made possible by a variety of techniques that we refer to collectively as 'biotelemetry'. This set of tools ranges from transmitters that send their signals to receivers up to a few kilometers away to those that send data to orbiting satellites and, more frequently, to devices that log data. They enable researchers to document, for long uninterrupted periods, how undisturbed organisms interact with each other and their environment in real time. In spite of advances enabling the monitoring of many physiological and behavioural variables across a range of taxa of various sizes, these devices have yet to be embraced widely by the ecological community. Our review suggests that this technology has immense potential for research in basic and applied animal ecology. Efforts to incorporate biotelemetry into broader ecological research programs should yield novel information that has been challenging to collect historically from free-ranging animals in their natural environments. Examples of research that would benefit from biotelemetry include the assessment of animal responses to different anthropogenic perturbations and the development of life-time energy budgets.},

abstract = {Reactive movement responses of prey are affected by habitat characteristics, such as cover, which determine predation risk. Open habitats with low cover facilitate predator detection, movement and escape, while closed habitats reduce the ability to detect predators and hinder movement. We performed a field experiment using nonlethal predators to study the reactive movement responses of medium-sized prey in patches with different vegetation characteristics related to elevated predation risk. Ten GPS-collared, free-ranging European hares, Lepus europaeus, were repeatedly subjected to a leashed dog and two humans in an experimental cross-over design. Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of the treatment and its interaction with vegetation parameters on the movement behaviour of the European hare. The reactive movement response was best explained by the model that included the interaction between elevated predation risk and vegetation structure. A strong immediate response was found in short vegetation up to 1 h after the treatment ended. The effect extended beyond the duration of the treatment and was synchronized with the resting and foraging period over the next 24 h. The distance covered between resting and foraging grounds was negatively affected, while use of less risky, low-quality vegetation during resting and foraging was favoured. Medium-sized prey species exhibit strong behavioural responses to the perceived predation risk, which we demonstrate here for the European hare. An elevated predation risk, for example by dogs, can trigger costly behavioural responses in these medium-sized prey species.},

abstract = {A theoretically valid proxy of energy expenditure is the acceleration of an animal's mass due to the movement of its body parts. Acceleration can be measured by an accelerometer and recorded onto a data logging device. Relevant studies have usually derived a measure of acceleration from the raw data that represents acceleration purely due to movement of the animal. This is termed 'overall dynamic body acceleration' (ODBA) and to date has proved a robust derivation of acceleration for use as an energy expenditure proxy. Acceleration data loggers are generally easy to deploy and the measures recorded appear robust to slight variation in location and orientation. This review discusses important issues concerning the accelerometry technique for estimating energy expenditure and ODBA; deriving ODBA, calibrating ODBA, acceleration logger recording frequencies, scenarios where ODBA is less likely to be valid, and the power in recording acceleration and heart rate together. While present evidence suggests that ODBA may not quantify energy expenditure during diving by birds and mammals, several recent studies have assessed changes in mechanical work in such species qualitatively through variation in ODBA during periods of submergence. The use of ODBA in field metabolic studies is likely to continue growing, supported by its relative ease of use and range of applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Large predators potentially can help shape the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, yet strong evidence of top-down herbivore limitation has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. Herein we synthesize outcomes of recent tri-trophic cascades studies involving the presence and absence of large predators for five national parks in the western United States, including Olympic, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, and Wind Cave. Historical observations by park biologists regarding woody browse species and recently compiled age structure data for deciduous trees indicate major impacts to woody plant communities by ungulates following the extirpation or displacement of large predators. Declines in long-term tree recruitment indexed additional effects to plant communities and ecological processes, as well as shifts towards alternative ecosystem states. The magnitude and consistency of vegetation impacts found within these five parks, in conjunction with other recent North American studies, indicate that broad changes to ecosystem processes and the lower trophic level may have occurred in other parts of the western United States where large predators have been extirpated or displaced. Thus, where ungulates have significantly altered native plant communities in the absence of large predators, restoration of native flora is urgently needed to recover former ecosystem services. Following the reintroduction of previously extirpated gray wolves Canis lupus into Yellowstone National Park, a spatially patchy recovery of woody browse species (e.g., aspen Populus tremuloides, willow Salix spp., cottonwood Populus spp.) has begun, indicating that large predator recovery may represent an important restoration strategy for ecosystems degraded by wild ungulates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In social primates, individuals use various tactics to compete for dominance rank. Grooming, displays and contact aggression are common components of a male chimpanzee's dominance repertoire. The optimal combination of these behaviors is likely to differ among males with individuals exhibiting a dominance "style" that reflects their tendency to use cooperative and/or agonistic dominance tactics. Here, we examine the grooming behavior of three alpha male chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We found that (1) these males differed significantly in their tendency to groom with other males; (2) each male's grooming patterns remained consistent before, during and after his tenure as alpha, and (3) the three males tended to groom with high- middle- and low-ranking partners equally. We suggest that body mass may be one possible determinant of differences in grooming behavior. The largest male exhibited the lowest overall grooming rates, whereas the smallest male spent the most time grooming others. This is probably because large males are more effective at physically intimidating subordinates. To achieve alpha status, a small male may need to compensate for reduced size by investing more time and energy in grooming, thereby ensuring coalitionary support from others. Rates of contact aggression and charging displays conformed to this prediction, suggesting that each male exhibited a different dominance "style."},

abstract = {We propose a new method, based on machine learning techniques, for the analysis of a combination of continuous data from dataloggers and a sampling of contemporaneous behaviour observations. This data combination provides an opportunity for biologists to study behaviour at a previously unknown level of detail and accuracy; however, continuously recorded data are of little use unless the resulting large volumes of raw data can be reliably translated into actual behaviour. We address this problem by applying a Support Vector Machine and a Hidden-Markov Model that allows us to classify an animal's behaviour using a small set of field observations to calibrate continuously recorded activity data. Such classified data can be applied quantitatively to the behaviour of animals over extended periods and at times during which observation is difficult or impossible. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method by applying it to data from six cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Cumulative activity data scores were recorded every five minutes by accelerometers embedded in GPS radio-collars for around one year on average. Direct behaviour sampling of each of the six cheetah were collected in the field for comparatively short periods. Using this approach we are able to classify each five minute activity score into a set of three key behaviour (feeding, mobile and stationary), creating a continuous behavioural sequence for the entire period for which the collars were deployed. Evaluation of our classifier with cross-validation shows the accuracy to be 83{\%}-94{\%}, but that the accuracy for individual classes is reduced with decreasing sample size of direct observations. We demonstrate how these processed data can be used to study behaviour identifying seasonal and gender differences in daily activity and feeding times. Results given here are unlike any that could be obtained using traditional approaches in both accuracy and detail.},

The mouse-deer was thought to be nocturnal, but diurnal distance moved per hour and behaviors observed directly in wild mouse-deer indicated that they were mainly active during the day and rested at night. Active individuals foraging or moving from shelter to shelter were mainly observed during the day, and inactive individuals resting on open forest floor were mainly observed during the night. Captive mouse-deer observed in a farm enclosure (1.5 ha in size) also showed activities similar to those observed in the forest. Radiotracking for 24 h revealed that mouse-deer significantly preferred crown-gap areas with dense undergrowth of creeping bamboo (Dinochloa) during the day but that they tended to move to the higher and drier ridge areas at night. These results indicated that mouse-deer used crown-gap areas as foraging sites and ridge areas as resting sites. Our results strongly suggest that mouse-deer use food resources in gap areas in tropical forests.},

abstract = {Abstract. Most ecosystems have multiple predator species that not only compete for shared prey, but also pose direct threats to each other. These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild pr{\'{e}}dation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.},

abstract = {Monitoring and describing the physical movements and body postures of animals is one of the most fundamental tasks of ethology. The more precise the observations are the more sophisticated the interpretations can be about the biology of a certain individual or species. Animal-borne data loggers have recently contributed much to the collection of motion-data from individuals, however, the problem of translating these measurements to distinct behavioural categories to create an ethogram is not overcome yet. The objective of the present study was to develop a “behaviour tracker”: a system composed of a multiple sensor data-logger device (with a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope) and a supervised learning algorithm as means of automated identification of the behaviour of freely moving dogs. We collected parallel sensor measurements and video recordings of each of our subjects (Belgian Malinois, N=12; Labrador Retrievers, N=12) that were guided through a predetermined series of standard activities. Seven behavioural categories (lay, sit, stand, walk, trot, gallop, canter) were pre-defined and each video recording was tagged accordingly. Evaluation of the measurements was performed by support vector machine (SVM) classification. During the analysis we used different combinations of independent measurements for training and validation (belonging to the same or different individuals or using different training data size) to determine the robustness of the application. We reached an overall accuracy of above 90{\%} perfect identification of all the defined seven categories of behaviour when both training and validation data belonged to the same individual, and over 80{\%} perfect recognition rate using a generalized training data set of multiple subjects. Our results indicate that the present method provides a good model for an easily applicable, fast, automatic behaviour classification system that can be trained with arbitrary motion patterns and potentially be applied to a wide range of species and situations.},

@article{Losos1988,
abstract = {A survey of 35 species indicates that monitor lizards (Varanus) typically hunt over large areas, search in particular microhabitats, and feed frequently on a wide variety of prey, many of which are relatively small. There is ontogenetic, seasonal, and geographic variation in diet. With some exceptions, invertebrates are the predominant prey, but rare predation on vertebrates is often energetically significant. A few monitors specialize on prey types that occur as occasional items in the diet of species with more generalized diets; these include crabs, snails, orthopterans, lizards, and large mammals. For most species, prey specialization occurs via habitat selection and a variety of prey types and sizes are eaten, as expected for widely searching predators. Comparisons with other anguimorphans suggest that derived features of Varanus are associated with high body temperature and activity levels; specialized chemoreception; and rapid, skillful capture of hidden and/or potentially hard to catch prey. Occasional ingestion of moderately large prey is primitive for Varanoidca (Helodermatidae +Varanidae), accentuating a trend that is perhaps primitive for anguimorphan lizards. Reduction of very large prey prior to ingestion is a derived attribute within Varanus, seen infrequently in several larger species and commonly in V. komodoensis. This study illustrates the synthesis of comparative natural history in a phylogenetic context, a method that addresses the history of organismal change.},

abstract = {Recent advances in animal tracking and telemetry technology have allowed the collection of location data at an ever-increasing rate and accuracy, and these advances have been accompanied by the development of new methods of data analysis for portraying space use, home ranges and utilization distributions. New statistical approaches include data-intensive techniques such as kriging and nonlinear generalized regression models for habitat use. In addition, mechanistic home-range models, derived from models of animal movement behaviour, promise to offer new insights into how home ranges emerge as the result of specific patterns of movements by individuals in response to their environment. Traditional methods such as kernel density estimators are likely to remain popular because of their ease of use. Large datasets make it possible to apply these methods over relatively short periods of time such as weeks or months, and these estimates may be analysed using mixed effects models, offering another approach to studying temporal variation in space-use patterns. Although new technologies open new avenues in ecological research, our knowledge of why animals use space in the ways we observe will only advance by researchers using these new technologies and asking new and innovative questions about the empirical patterns they observe.},

@article{Hsiang2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:The highly derived morphology and astounding diversity of snakes has long inspired debate regarding the ecological and evolutionary origin of both the snake total-group (Pan-Serpentes) and crown snakes (Serpentes). Although speculation abounds on the ecology, behavior, and provenance of the earliest snakes, a rigorous, clade-wide analysis of snake origins has yet to be attempted, in part due to a dearth of adequate paleontological data on early stem snakes. Here, we present the first comprehensive analytical reconstruction of the ancestor of crown snakes and the ancestor of the snake total-group, as inferred using multiple methods of ancestral state reconstruction. We use a combined-data approach that includes new information from the fossil record on extinct crown snakes, new data on the anatomy of the stem snakes Najash rionegrina, Dinilysia patagonica, and Coniophis precedens, and a deeper understanding of the distribution of phenotypic apomorphies among the major clades of fossil and Recent snakes. Additionally, we infer time-calibrated phylogenies using both new 'tip-dating' and traditional node-based approaches, providing new insights on temporal patterns in the early evolutionary history of snakes.RESULTS:Comprehensive ancestral state reconstructions reveal that both the ancestor of crown snakes and the ancestor of total-group snakes were nocturnal, widely foraging, non-constricting stealth hunters. They likely consumed soft-bodied vertebrate and invertebrate prey that was subequal to head size, and occupied terrestrial settings in warm, well-watered, and well-vegetated environments. The snake total-group - approximated by the Coniophis node - is inferred to have originated on land during the middle Early Cretaceous ({\~{}}128.5Ma), with the crown-group following about 20 million years later, during the Albian stage. Our inferred divergence dates provide strong evidence for a major radiation of henophidian snake diversity in the wake of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction, clarifying the pattern and timing of the extant snake radiation. Although the snake crown-group most likely arose on the supercontinent of Gondwana, our results suggest the possibility that the snake total-group originated on Laurasia.CONCLUSIONS:Our study provides new insights into when, where, and how snakes originated, and presents the most complete picture of the early evolution of snakes to date. More broadly, we demonstrate the striking influence of including fossils and phenotypic data in combined analyses aimed at both phylogenetic topology inference and ancestral state reconstruction.},

abstract = {Distinguishing specific behavioural modes from data collected by animal-borne tri-axial accelerometers can be a time-consuming and subjective process. Data synthesis can be further inhibited when the tri-axial acceleration data cannot be paired with the corresponding behavioural mode through direct observation. Here, we explored the use of a tame surrogate (domestic dog) to build a behavioural classification module, and then used that module to accurately identify and quantify behavioural modes within acceleration collected from other individuals/species. Tri-axial acceleration data were recorded from a domestic dog whilst it was commanded to walk, run, sit, stand and lie-down. Through video synchronisation, each tri-axial acceleration sample was annotated with its associated behavioural mode; the feature vectors were extracted and used to build the classification module through the application of support vector machines (SVMs). This behavioural classification module was then used to identify and quantify the same behavioural modes in acceleration collected from a range of other species (alligator, badger, cheetah, dingo, echidna, kangaroo and wombat). Evaluation of the module performance, using a binary classification system, showed there was a high capacity ({\textgreater}90{\%}) for behaviour recognition between individuals of the same species. Furthermore, a positive correlation existed between SVM capacity and the similarity of the individual's spinal length-to-height above the ground ratio (SL:SH) to that of the surrogate. The study describes how to build a behavioural classification module and highlights the value of using a surrogate for studying cryptic, rare or endangered species.},

abstract = {1. Questionnaires, or social surveys, are used increasingly as a means of collecting data in ecology. We present a critical review of their use and give recommendations for good practice.

2. We searched for papers in which questionnaires were used in 57 ecological academic journals, published over the period 1991–2003 inclusive. This provided a total sample size of 168 questionnaires from 127 papers published in 22 academic journals.

3. Most questionnaires were carried out in North America and western Europe, and addressed species-level issues, principally focusing on mammals. The majority were concerned with impacts of species and/or their conservation, and just under half with human–wildlife interactions.

4. Postal survey was the method used most frequently to carry out the questionnaires, followed by in-person interviews. Some questionnaires were conducted by telephone, and none was web-based.

5. Most questionnaires were concerned with obtaining factual information or perceptions of facts. Ground-truthing (independent verification of the facts) was carried out in less than 10{\%} of questionnaires.

6. The mean (± SE) sample size (number of respondents) per questionnaire was 1422 ± 261 and the average (± SE) response rate was 63 ± 3{\%}. These figures varied widely depending on the methods used to conduct the questionnaire.

7. The analysis of data was mostly descriptive. Simple univariate methods were the most frequently used statistical tools, and data from a third of questionnaires were not subjected to any analysis beyond simple descriptions of the results.

8. Synthesis and applications. We provide recommendations for best practice in the future use of questionnaires in ecology, as follows: (i) the definition of the target population, any hypotheses to be tested and procedures for the selection of participants should be clearly documented; (ii) questionnaires should be piloted prior to their use; (iii) the sample size should be sufficient for the statistical analysis; (iv) the rationale for the choice of survey method should be clearly stated; (v) the number of non-respondents should be minimized; (vi) the question and answer format should be kept as simple as possible; (vii) the structure of the questionnaire and the data emerging from it should be unambiguously shown in any publication; (viii) bias arising from non-response should be quantified; (ix) the accuracy of data should be assessed by ground-truthing where relevant; (x) the analysis of potentially interrelated data should be done by means of modelling. Researchers should also consider whether alternative, interpretative methods, such as in-depth interviews or participatory approaches, may be more appropriate, for example where the focus is on elucidating motivations or perceptions rather than testing factual hypotheses.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, wolf Canis lupus predation in northern Spain has focused on wild ungulates, even though livestock and other prey, such as other carnivores and small mammals, and garbage have been available. During 1994 and 1995, we studied the impact of wolf predation on wild boar Sus scrofa in four study areas in Asturias, Spain. The diet of the wolf was assessed by scat collection and analysis (N = 106, 329, 372 and 649, respectively). The mortality of wild boar was deduced from density estimates and hunting records from the Nature Reserve of Somiedo. Wild boar represented 3-31{\%} of the biomass of food found in the wolf scats in the study areas. We estimated that 75{\%} of wild boars eaten were piglets. The wild boar mortality rate was estimated at 38{\%} (146 dead individuals out of 385). Wolf predation was estimated to cause 12{\%} of the mortality of wild boar and to affect 4.5{\%} of the wild boar population. Hunting had a higher importance as a mortality factor than wolf predation (31 and 12{\%}, respectively). Even though, a two-year study is insufficient to come to a final conclusion, our results suggest that wolf predation may have a low impact on young wild boar and that a hunting pressure of the size we found is unlikely to control the wild boar population.},

Along with these advances, researchers are challenged with understanding the proper methods to assess size of home range or migratory movements of various species. The most acceptable method of home-range analysis with uncorrelated locations, kernel-density estimation (KDE), has been lauded by some for use with GPS technology (Kie et al., 2010) while criticized by others for errors in proper bandwidth selection (Hemson et al., 2005) and violation of independence assumptions (Swihart {\&} Slade 1985b). The issue of autocorrelation or independence in location data has been dissected repeatedly by users of KDE for decades (Swihart {\&} Slade 1985a; Worton 1995, but see Fieberg 2007) and can be especially problematic with data collected with GPS technology. Recently, alternative methods were developed to address the issues with bandwidth selection for KDE and autocorrelated GPS data. Brownian bridge movement},

Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in $\beta$ diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses.

abstract = {Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution ({\textgreater}10 Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Models of inter-sexual selection generally assume heritable variation in mating preferences among females within populations. However, little is known about the nature of such variation. The aim of this study was to characterize quantitatively the phenotypic variation in female preference for a sexually selected male trait, body colour pattern, within a population of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Significantly more female guppies preferred the more brightly coloured of two similar-sized males presented simultaneously as potential mates. Mating preference scores for individual females were significantly and positively correlated between two repeated trials on successive days. Females were thus individually consistent in their particular choice of mates, and the calculated repeatability of their mating preference was relatively high. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, significant variation existed among females in the degree of their preference for brightly coloured males. Individual mating preference scores were not normally distributed, but were rather skewed to the right (i.e. towards greater values). These results suggest that additive genetic variation for mating preferences based on male colour pattern is maintained, and the opportunity for the further evolution of both bright male colour patterns and female preference for this trait appears to exist in the study population from the Quare River, Trinidad},

abstract = {An environmental enrichment device was designed and evluated for captive chimpanzees. The puzzleboard consisted of a 61-cm, square piece of plastic with holes of various sizes drilled into the center. The puzzleboard was bolted to the roof of a chimpanzee enclosure. Flavored primate treats were arranged on top of the board, and the chimpanzee used a finger to manipulate the food across the board to be retrieved through the larger holes. The behavior and puzzle use of 29 chimpanzees housed in eight groups were evaluated while the device was empty and while filled with food. For each group, four 1-hr scan samples were recorded for each condition. Data showed that an average of 40 min elapsed from the time the puzzleboard was filled to the last recorded contact by a subject. Mean individual use ranged from 4.8 to 23.8 min/hr. Female chimpanzees used the puzzle significantly more often than did males. Aggressive, affiliative, inactive and self-directed behaviors were significantly reduced when the puzzle was filled. In addition, the puzzleboard was inexpensive, sturdy, and easily constructed, mounted, and operated.},

abstract = {1. The energetic costs of different behaviours are critical in modulating the behavioural ecology of free-living animals. Despite this, measurement of energy expenditure in the field has proved difficult. 2. A new method with broad application for field studies has been proposed for determining the rate at which animals expend energy, based on measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) through the attachment of miniature acceleration data-loggers. This technique is easy to implement and has the promise to be able to resolve energy expenditure with fine (sub-second) temporal resolution, making it the only method which promises to able to determine the cost of short-lived behaviours. Increasing evidence supports the validity of the approach although the rationale behind it is vague. 3. This study explores link between metabolic energy and acceleration by examining what is known about how muscular tissue converts metabolic energy to mechanical work via muscular contraction and how Newtonian physics facilitates a derivation of Power (the rate at which work is performed) from acceleration. The link between metabolic energy and acceleration appears to involve three discrete processes: (i) the ratio of mechanical work to metabolic work performed by a single muscle (mechano-chemical efficiency); (ii) the ratio of external and internal work performed (mechanical work of the limbs in relation to that of the centre of mass); and (iii) the ratio of inertial to de novo mechanical work. These processes may vary according to the animal's mass, the medium in which it travels and its gait or behaviour. 4. Assessment of movement has limited application in defining non-movement energy expenditure such as that involved in specific dynamic action or non-shivering thermogenesis. However, this non-movement energy expenditure may often be modelled with reasonable confidence. The utility and appropriateness of the ODBA-energy expenditure method depends on a set of conditions, which we define and suggest should be assessed a priori. 5. This study explores the framework behind the ODBA-energy expenditure method to enable informed decisions to be made regarding the suitability for specific research questions addressed, as well as highlighting calibration needs.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Most studies on the relationship between home-range size and composition focus on natural factors, whereas effects of anthropogenic factors are poorly understood. I evaluated effects of multiple natural and anthropogenic habitat factors, population density, and sex on the annual home-range size of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in well-preserved forest areas in the Dinaric Mountains of Slovenia, Europe, based on {\textgreater}11,000 telemetry locations from 17 males and 25 females. Home ranges were 90-2,107 ha and averaged 460 ha. Using a mixed linear model, I estimated that home-range size decreased with increasing 1) red deer density, 2) supplemental feeding intensity, and 3) average annual temperature; 4) home-range size increased as the distance of main roads from the edge of the home range increased; and 5) males had a larger home range than females (580 ha versus 400 ha). These results were explained by effects of food availability (1, 2, and 3), energy expenditure of an individual (4 and 5), intraspecific interactions (1 and 5), and size of unfragmented habitat patches (4) on home-range size. To my knowledge, this is the 1st large mammal study to explicitly show that the density and spatial distribution of roads and supplemental feeding affect home-range size of red deer and that humans can have a greater impact on home-range size and shape than natural habitat factors. Ungulates are often supplementally fed to increase their value to hunters and to reduce forest damage, particularly in Europe; however, this practice can greatly reduce the home-range size, potentially leading to increased disease transmission and competition associated with the higher deer densities around feeding sites, which can result in just the opposite of what was intended.},

abstract = {Mangrove species are uniquely adapted to tropical and subtropical coasts, and although relatively low in number of species, mangrove forests provide at least US {\$}1.6 billion each year in ecosystem services and support coastal livelihoods worldwide. Globally, mangrove areas are declining rapidly as they are cleared for coastal development and aquaculture and logged for timber and fuel production. Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16{\%}) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40{\%} of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss. Several species at high risk of extinction may disappear well before the next decade if existing protective measures are not enforced.},

We made three types of approach to nests (walking, running or leading a dog). We measured the flush distance, length of time parents spent off the nest and distraction display intensity. Leading a dog caused the greatest disruption of incubation, while responses to walking and running approaches did not differ significantly. Distraction display intensity appeared to be unrelated to approach type. There was evidence of habituation to humans on busy beaches. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that shorebirds perceive dogs as posing more of a threat than humans on foot, and that their subsequent avoidance response is greater. We recommend that human activity, particularly the walking of dogs, should be limited near nesting sites. Further study on causes of nest failure is required. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Satellite tracking was used to follow the movements of a problematic top-order carnivore, the wild dog (Canis lupus dingo, C. lupus familiaris and their hybrids), in contiguous forested landscapes in south-eastern mainland Australia. Home range sizes of wild dogs were much larger than previously determined using conventional telemetry methods, averaging 10,000 ha with a maximum size of 59,000 ha over approximate 3-month periods. Wild dogs at sites with high abundance of kangaroos, wallabies and rabbits had smaller areas of occupancy than did dogs at sites with low availability of these preys. Despite mostly large home ranges, tracked animals were loyal to publicly-owned tenure and there were few instances where individuals moved large distances on to adjacent private tenure. Instead, movement behaviours of most tracked animals were characterised by repeated short distance forays, often at acute angles from previous locations. Consequently, home ranges were stable and otherwise well defined. Analysis of DNA from our study animals indicated that most individuals were of 'dingo' ancestry, but otherwise considered hybrids because of the presence of domestic dog genes. Only two of 24 animals could be considered as 'pure' dingo. Contemporary wild dog management demarcates lands where control is or is not undertaken, with the latter notionally acting to 'conserve' dingoes. Due to the large scale of movement of animals, existing control efforts likely impact over a greater area than previously suspected. Furthermore, our genetic findings suggest that conservation of dingoes in south-eastern mainland Australia is difficult to achieve. A modified approach to wild dog management is needed, taking account of the extent of range of individual animals and the existing genetic characteristics of populations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {high day-to-day variability in time spent above ground and ODBA with most of the variance explained by environmental conditions known to affect thermal exchange. In both years, females spent more time below ground compared with males during parturition and early lactation; however, this difference was fourfold larger in the second year, possibly, because females were in better body condition. Daily ODBA positively correlated with time spent above ground in both sexes, but females were more active per unit time above ground. Consequently, daily ODBA did not differ between the sexes when femaleswere early in lactation, even though females were above ground three to six fewer hours each day. Further, on top of having the additional burden of milk production,ODBAdata indicate females also had fragmented rest patterns and were more active during late lactation. Our results indicate that sex differences in reproductive requirements can have a substantial influence on activity patterns, but the size of this effect may be dependent on capital resources accrued during gestation.},

abstract = {Biobased fibres of cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and triethyl citrate (TEC) as plasticiser were prepared by melt spinning. To obtain homogeneous dispersion of CNC, two different dispersion techniques were studied. In the first, the water content of the CNC suspension was reduced and exchanged to ethanol using centrifugation. In the second, the water in the CNC suspension was completely exchanged to ethanol by sol-gel process. Results showed that tensile modulus and tensile strength of the nanocomposite fibres produced with the first technique were lower than CAB-TEC fibres, but the fibres produced by the sol-gel process showed an increase in the tensile modulus and had no decrease in the strength. Optical microscopy of the fibres indicated a few aggregations on the sol-gel prepared materials. The results indicate that the sol-gel process is enhancing the dispersion of CNC and can be a suitable way to prepare nanocomposite fibres. {\textcopyright} Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2014.},

abstract = {Large predators potentially can help shape the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, yet strong evidence of top-down herbivore limitation has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. Herein we synthesize outcomes of recent tri-trophic cascades studies involving the presence and absence of large predators for five national parks in the western United States, including Olympic, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, and Wind Cave. Historical observations by park biologists regarding woody browse species and recently compiled age structure data for deciduous trees indicate major impacts to woody plant communities by ungulates following the extirpation or displacement of large predators. Declines in long-term tree recruitment indexed additional effects to plant communities and ecological processes, as well as shifts towards alternative ecosystem states. The magnitude and consistency of vegetation impacts found within these five parks, in conjunction with other recent North American studies, indicate that broad changes to ecosystem processes and the lower trophic level may have occurred in other parts of the western United States where large predators have been extirpated or displaced. Thus, where ungulates have significantly altered native plant communities in the absence of large predators, restoration of native flora is urgently needed to recover former ecosystem services. Following the reintroduction of previously extirpated gray wolves Canis lupus into Yellowstone National Park, a spatially patchy recovery of woody browse species (e.g., aspen Populus tremuloides, willow Salix spp., cottonwood Populus spp.) has begun, indicating that large predator recovery may represent an important restoration strategy for ecosystems degraded by wild ungulates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Various controlled densities of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, wer observed in order to determine the effects of population density on frequency of courtship and agonistic interactions. Populations with single male exhibit a low level of courtship activity; the presence of a second male increases this level of activity markedly. Populations with a 1:1 sex ratio in densities greater than one pair exhibit a constant mean number of courtship interactions but, with increased crowding, an increasing variance in level of courtship activity. This results in a frequency profile of courtship interaction characteristic of each observed density. Each population density exhibits a density-dependent pattern of social interaction defined quantitatively by frequencies of courtship aggressive interactions at the population level. The contribution of the behaviour of individual males and to this patterning of social interaction in each population was partially determined.},

abstract = {Constriction of prey by gopher snakes Pituophis melanoleucus and king$\backslash$nsnakes Lampropeltis getula is$\backslash$n$\backslash$nhighly variable in posture, muscular activity and force exertion.$\backslash$nThese snakes typically use lateral bends of$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe anterior trunk to wind the body into a vertical coil around the$\backslash$nprey. Three common constriction$\backslash$n$\backslash$npostures are fully encircling loops that form a coil, partially encircling$\backslash$nloops, and non-encircling loops that$\backslash$n$\backslash$npinion the prey. Initial tightening of a coil occurs by winding or$\backslash$npressing the loops tighter to reduce the$\backslash$n$\backslash$ndiameter of the coil. The epaxial muscles are highly active during$\backslash$nstriking and coil formation and$\backslash$n$\backslash$nintermittently active during sustained constriction. These results$\backslash$nrefute the hypothesis of a mechanical$\backslash$n$\backslash$nconstraint on constriction in snakes with elongate epaxial muscles.$\backslash$nConstricting gopher and king snakes$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncan detect muscular, ventilatory and circulatory movements in rodent$\backslash$nprey. In response to simulated$\backslash$n$\backslash$nheartbeats or ventilation in mice, the snakes twitch visibly, recruit$\backslash$nepaxial muscle activity, and increase$\backslash$n$\backslash$nconstriction pressure temporarily, but then quickly relax. Muscular$\backslash$nactivity and constriction pressure are$\backslash$n$\backslash$nincreased most and sustained longest in response to muscular struggling$\backslash$nin prey. Although muscle activity$\backslash$n$\backslash$nand pressure exertion are intermittent, the constriction posture is$\backslash$nmaintained until the prey has been$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncompletely still for several seconds; thus, a snake can reapply pressure$\backslash$nin response to any circulatory,$\backslash$n$\backslash$nventilatory or muscular movement by the prey. The pressures of 6.1±30.9$\backslash$nkPa (46±232 mm Hg) exerted on$\backslash$n$\backslash$nsmall mammal prey by constricting snakes range from about half to$\backslash$nover twice a mouse's systolic blood$\backslash$n$\backslash$npressure, and are probably 10 times larger than the venous pressure.$\backslash$nThese high pressures probably kill$\backslash$n$\backslash$nmammalian prey by inducing immediate circulatory and cardiac arrest,$\backslash$nrather than by suffocation alone.},

abstract = {As the environment becomes increasingly altered by human development, the importance of understanding the ways in which wildlife interact with modified landscapes is becoming clear. Areas such as industrial sites are sometimes presumed to have little conservation value, but many of these sites have areas of less disturbed habitats around their core infrastructure, which could provide ideal conditions to support some species, such as mesocarnivores. We conducted the first assessments of the density of serval (Leptailurus serval) at the Secunda Synfuels Operations plant, South Africa, using camera trap surveys analysed within a spatially explicit capture recapture framework. We show that servals occurred at densities of 76.20–101.21 animals per 100 km², which are higher than previously recorded densities for this species, presumably due to high abundance of prey and the absence of persecution and/or competitor species. Our findings highlight the significant conservation potential of industrialised sites, and we suggest that such sites could help contribute towards meeting conservation goals.},

abstract = {Prey density is declining throughout the tiger's (Panthera tigris) range$\backslash$nand knowledge of the ecological factors that affect prey distribution$\backslash$nand abundance remains surprisingly limited for this globally endangered$\backslash$nspecies. In this study, we examined the ecological variables influencing$\backslash$nthe abundance of sambar (Rusa unicolor), the dominant prey species for$\backslash$nthe tiger across its global southern range. We also identified the scale$\backslash$nat which these variables impact sambar distribution in Huai Kha Khaeng$\backslash$nWildlife Sanctuary, a high tiger density site in Southeast Asia. The$\backslash$nfecal pellet group accumulation method was used to estimate an index of$\backslash$nsambar abundance. Pellet groups were counted along 360 line transects$\backslash$nrandomly placed among four approximately 100 km(2) sites that$\backslash$nencompassed six female tiger home ranges. The relationship between$\backslash$nsambar pellet-group counts and 10 environmental variables was$\backslash$ninvestigated using generalised linear mixed models. The sambar abundance$\backslash$nindex was negatively associated with distance to the largest river in$\backslash$nthe study area, elevation, and the amount of dry deciduous dipterocarp$\backslash$nforest cover. Distribution and abundance of sambar were positively$\backslash$nassociated with relatively flat areas of river valleys, presumably due$\backslash$nto the quality of vegetation available for foraging and greater$\backslash$nvisibility for detecting predators compared to other portions of the$\backslash$nstudy area.

abstract = {A paradoxical task of the venom gland of snakes is the synthesis and storage of an instantly available suite of toxins to immobilize prey and the protection of the snake against its own venom components. Furthermore, autolysis of the venom constituents due to the action of venom metalloproteases is an additional problem, particularly among viperid venoms, which are typically rich in lytic enzymatic proteins. To address questions concerning these problems, the structure of the venom gland was investigated using light microscopy, SEM and TEM. The composition of the venom originating from the intact venom apparatus or from the main venom gland alone was analyzed by electrophoresis, and the pH of freshly expressed venom as well as pH optima of several representative enzymes was evaluated. Results from several species of rattlesnakes demonstrated that the venom gland is structurally complex, particularly in its small rostral portion called the accessory gland, which may be a site of activation of venom components. Secreted venom is stable in extremes of temperature and dilution, and several proximate mechanisms, including pH and endogenous inhibitors, exist which inhibit enzymatic activity of the venom during storage within the venom gland but allow for spontaneous activation upon injection into prey. Whereas acid secretion by the parietal cells activates digestive enzymes in the stomach, within the venom gland acidification inhibits venom enzymes. We propose that the mitochondria-rich cells of the main venom gland, which are morphologically and histochemically very similar to the parietal cells of the mammalian gastric pit, play a central role in the stabilization of the venom by secreting acidic compounds into the venom and maintaining the stored venom at pH 5.4. Hence, our results indicate yet another trophic link between the processes of venom production and of digestion, and demonstrate that the venom glands of snakes may represent an excellent model for the study of protein stability and maintenance of toxic proteins. ?? 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {1. Energetics of reproduction in birds is reviewed with the question in mind how the parent adjusts its effort in relation to prevailing environmental conditions in order to maximize the output of young in its lifetime. Emphasis is on proximate controls, rather than ultimate factors measurable in terms of adult survival and recruitment of young. 2. The decision to breed or not to breed is clearly related to body condition of the female, presumably because of the implications this has for survival. 3. Laying date and clutch size are likewise under the influence of female condition and can hence be modified by experiments involving supplementary feeding. Natural variation in these features may often be related to territory quality. 4. How the bird decides whether or not to commence a second brood is not clear, but in the Great Tit the habitat-related difference in incidence of second broods is functionally understandable when survival probabilities of birds at different times are considered. 5. A distinction is made between a "capital" and "income" model for translatting rates of change of female body condition into appropriate decisions on laying date and clutch size and experiments are suggested that discriminate between the two. 6. Lack's view that brood size is in an evolutionary sense adjusted in order to balance food requirement and foraging capacity of the parents is accepted, and growth rates in nidicolous birds are analysed to ascertain if a finer adjustment exists superimposed on the integer steps of brood adjustment. Critical for this analysis are groups of birds where broods of one are common, since only in these circumstances is growth adjustment the only strategy open to the parents. In common with other animals, growth rate is related to mature body size but within a category of adult weight clear examples can be found for retardation of growth rate in pelecaniform and charadriiform species with singleton broods. 7. Since daily energy requirement is related to nestling size and growth rate, retardation of growth is explicable as a strategy only in terms of reducing the daily commitment of the parents, not reducing the total cost of producing a nestling. 8. An additional economy in growth is to reduce the contribution of fat to the nestling body. 9. Implied in Lack's view of brood size is a limitation of parental foraging capacity, and the last section of the paper is devoted to exploration of the proximate factors delimiting what Royama terms the optimal working capacity of parents feeding young. Observations of parent starlings confronted with manipulated brood size suggest a limit on the time that can be devoted to energetically extravagant flight activity, rather than a shortage of absolute time. Beyond the limit to which stressed parents can be made to fly, body weight declines. 10. Preliminary data on energy metabolized daily by parents confronted with large broods conforms to the simplified view that parental effort on a sustained basis equates to energy mobilization equivalent to 4 B.M.R. units and it is suggested that this level of energy expenditure represents a proximal decision substrate for determining the optimal working capacity of the parent. 11. The paper ends with a plea for more research on the proximate controls of avian reproduction, and calls attention to the central importance of the protein bank to parental body condition.},

Behavioural change in reptiles, as in other animals, is often the primary indicator of disturbance, injury or disease. Just as a behavioural sign may be an indicator of stress or a physical problem, a physical sign may be an indicator of a behavioural problem, and abnormal behaviour may result in injury and disease. This article focuses on abnormal behaviour in reptiles, including signs of captivity-stress, injury and disease and their aetiologies, and takes a fresh look at some old and established biological and husbandry problems. Concise diagnostic guidance on behaviour issues is also included. The article might serve to prompt questions that may be asked of reptile keepers when evaluating animal and husbandry background},

abstract = {A new method of synthesis of the locust gregarization pheromone, locustol, is described, the pathway being from guaiacol to acetyl-isoacetovanillone, to isoacetovanillone, to 5-ethylguaiacol. These substances were all checked for their infrared spectra and were bioassayed. Only 5-ethylguaiacol affected chiasma frequency, hopper colour, and the morphometric ratio, although guaiacol had some effect on chiasma frequency. Hopper and adult faeces, as well as grasshopper faeces, were steamextracted, tested by infrared spectrophotometry and by gas chromatography, and were bioassayed. Only the hopper faeces extract contained the pheromone as well as some isoacetovanillone. In the adult and grasshopper faeces extracts no aromatic substance could be found but the impurities contained, possibly, a mixture of a secondary alcohol, a carboxylic acid, and/or its ester, some of which also occurred in the impure hopper faeces extract. Isovanillin, 5-methylguaiacol, and amylacetate were also bioassayed: they showed no effect on chiasma frequencies, but the latter stimulated the production of a gregaria ratio in solitaries. A figure is given of the chemical structures of eight substances which are part-analogues of locustol in regard to chiasma frequency, and of eight related substances which are chromosomally inactive but of which amylacetate stimulates the gregaria ratio and methylformate stimulates the production of black hopper colour in solitaries. A consideration of these structures may aid in solving the chemical action of locustol.},

abstract = {Objective—To determine the effect of various UVB radiation sources on plasma 25- hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni). Animals—18 healthy Hermann's tortoises. Procedures—Tortoises were exposed to sunlight in an outdoor enclosure located in the natural geographic range of Hermann's tortoises (n = 6 tortoises) or a self-ballasted mercury- vapor lamp (6) or fluorescent UVB-emitting lamp (6) in an indoor enclosure for 35 days. Plasma samples were obtained from each tortoise on the first (day 0) and last (day 35) days of the study, and concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were determined. Amount of UVB radiation in enclosures was measured. Results—Mean ± SD plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations for tortoises exposed to the mercury-vapor and fluorescent lamps were significantly lower on day 35 (155.69 ± 80.71 nmol/L and 134.42 ± 51.42 nmol/L, respectively) than they were on day 0 (368.02 ± 119.34 nmol/L and 313.69 ± 109.54 nmol/L, respectively). Mean ± SD plasma 25- hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration for tortoises exposed to sunlight did not differ significantly between days 0 (387.74 ± 114.56 nmol/L) and 35 (411.51 ± 189.75 nmol/L). Mean day 35 plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration was significantly higher for tortoises exposed to sunlight versus those exposed to mercury-vapor or fluorescent lamps. Sunlight provided significantly more UVB radiation than did the mercury-vapor or fluorescent lamps. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations differed between tortoises exposed to sunlight and those exposed to artificial UVB sources. Exposure to sunlight at a latitude similar to that of the natural geographic range is recommended for healthy and calcium-deficient tortoises. (Am J Vet Res 2012;73:1781–1786)},

abstract = {Monitoring and describing the physical movements and body postures of animals is one of the most fundamental tasks of ethology. The more precise the observations are the more sophisticated the interpretations can be about the biology of a certain individual or species. Animal-borne data loggers have recently contributed much to the collection of motion-data from individuals, however, the problem of translating these measurements to distinct behavioural categories to create an ethogram is not overcome yet. The objective of the present study was to develop a “behaviour tracker”: a system composed of a multiple sensor data-logger device (with a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope) and a supervised learning algorithm as means of automated identification of the behaviour of freely moving dogs. We collected parallel sensor measurements and video recordings of each of our subjects (Belgian Malinois, N=12; Labrador Retrievers, N=12) that were guided through a predetermined series of standard activities. Seven behavioural categories (lay, sit, stand, walk, trot, gallop, canter) were pre-defined and each video recording was tagged accordingly. Evaluation of the measurements was performed by support vector machine (SVM) classification. During the analysis we used different combinations of independent measurements for training and validation (belonging to the same or different individuals or using different training data size) to determine the robustness of the application. We reached an overall accuracy of above 90{\%} perfect identification of all the defined seven categories of behaviour when both training and validation data belonged to the same individual, and over 80{\%} perfect recognition rate using a generalized training data set of multiple subjects. Our results indicate that the present method provides a good model for an easily applicable, fast, automatic behaviour classification system that can be trained with arbitrary motion patterns and potentially be applied to a wide range of species and situations.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of UV-b radiation on plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and ionised calcium concentrations in ball pythons (Python regius). Blood samples were taken from 14 ball pythons, which had never been exposed to UV-b light, to obtain baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and ionised calcium concentrations. Blood samples were then taken again from the same snakes 70 days later after one group (Group 1, n=6 females) were exposed to UV-b radiation daily, and the other group (Group 2, n=5 males and 3 females) were exposed to no UV-b radiation. Mean±sd 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels on day 0 in Group 1 were 197±35 nmol/l, and on day 70 were 203.5±13.8 nmol/l. Mean±sd 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels in Group 2 on day 0 were 77.7±41.5 nmol/l, and on day 70 were 83.0±41.9 nmol/l. Mean±sd ionised calcium levels at day 0 were 1.84±0.05 mmol/l for Group 1, and on day 70 were 1.78±0.07 mmol/l. Mean±sd ionised calcium levels at day 0 were 1.79±0.07 mmol/l for Group 2, and on day 70 were 1.81±0.05 mmol/l. No association was demonstrated between exposure to UV-b radiation and plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and ionised calcium concentrations.

However, there are few published studies on which to gauge their general utility and success. This paper highlights issues faced by some of the first researchers to use GPS technology for terrestrial mammal tracking in Australia. Our collated data cover 24 studies where GPS collars were used in 280 deployments on 13 species, including dingoes or other wild dogs (Canis lupus dingo and hybrids), cats (Felis catus), foxes (Vulpes vulpes), kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus), livestock guardian dogs (C. l. familiaris), pademelons (Thylogale billardierii), possums (Trichosurus cunninghami), quolls (Dasyurus geoffroii and D. maculatus), wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus and Petrogale lateralis), and wombats (Vombatus ursinus). Common problems encountered were associated with collar design, the GPS,VHFand timed-release components, and unforseen costs in retrieving and refurbishing collars. We discuss the implications of collar failures for research programs and animal welfare, and suggest how these could be avoided or improved. Our intention is to provide constructive advice so that researchers and manufacturers can make informed decisions about using this technology, and maximise the many benefits of GPS while reducing the risks.},

abstract = {Most analyses of the relationship between group size and food intake of social carnivores have shown a discrepancy between the group size that maximizes energy intake and that which is most frequently observed. Around southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, killer whales of the so-called transient form forage in small groups, and appear to prey exclusively on marine mammals. Between 1986 and 1993, in approximately 434 h of observations on transient killer whales, we observed 138 attacks on five species of marine mammals. Harbor seals were most frequently attacked (130 occasions), and the observed average energy intake rate was more than sufficient for the whale's energetic needs. Energy intake varied with group size, with groups of three having the highest energy intake rate per individual. While groups of three were most frequently encountered, the group size experienced by an average individual in the population (i.e., typical group size) is larger dian three. However, comparisons between observed and expected group sizes should utilize only groups engaged in the behavior of interest. The typical size of groups consisting only of adult and subadult whales that were engaged primarily in foraging activities confirms that these individuals are found in groups that are consistent with the maximization of energy intake hypothesis. Larger groups may form for (1) the occasional hunting of prey other than harbor seals, for which the optimal foraging group size is probably larger than three; and (2) the protection of calves and other social functions.},

abstract = {    * Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized.   * Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets.   * Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation.   * ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed.   * We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.  },

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

Nationwide, in a single year, free-ranging dogs attacked 25{\%} of the ca. 8500 farms included in the survey, killing or injuring about 10 000 small ruminants. These dogs were ranked as the main cause of animal losses for small-scale farmers, representing a threat to the livelihoods of this vulnerable group. Further, free-ranging dogs attacking small ruminants were considered as human-subsidized, since they would be recruited by irresponsible ownership and abandonment from urban centers. This is the first national assessment reporting that human-subsidized dogs are a main threat to livestock rearing. Policies to control populations of these animals should target their anthropogenic origin as well as cultural shifts in dog ownership and animal welfare. While these policies may be effective mid- to long-term approaches, short-term actions may also be needed.},

This problem can be addressed by using animal attached accelerometers and automatic classifiers. This study considers the feasibility of using specially designed hardware to capture three-dimensional accelerometer data from sheep and to subsequently automatically classify their behaviour on the basis of these measurements. Five common be- haviours have been identified: Lying, standing, walking, running and grazing. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifiers were trained based on 10 features. A greedy selection procedure was used to determine which features provide the highest classification accuracy. It is shown that both classifiers can automatically identify the five behaviours with high accuracy when all the features are used for training. The LDA and QDA classifiers achieved an overall accu- racy of 87.1{\%} and 89.7{\%} respectively. Grazing was misclassified the most in both classifiers, because it was confused with lying. This result was expected considering the high similarity between the raw accelerometer data associated with grazing and lying. The QDA classifier showed larger improvements when using a smaller},

abstract = {Population control of socially complex species may have profound ecological implications that remain largely invisible if only their abundance is considered. Here we discuss the effects of control on a socially complex top-order predator, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo). Since European occupation of Australia, dingoes have been controlled over much of the continent. Our aim was to investigate the effects of control on their abundance and social stability. We hypothesized that dingo abundance and social stability are not linearly related, and proposed a theoretical model in which dingo populations may fluctuate between three main states: (A) below carrying capacity and socially fractured, (B) above carrying capacity and socially fractured, or (C) at carrying capacity and socially stable. We predicted that lethal control would drive dingoes into the unstable states A or B, and that relaxation of control would allow recovery towards C. We tested our predictions by surveying relative abundance (track density) and indicators of social stability (scent-marking and howling) at seven sites in the arid zone subject to differing degrees of control. We also monitored changes in dingo abundance and social stability following relaxation and intensification of control. Sites where dingoes had been controlled within the previous two years were characterized by low scent-marking activity, but abundance was similar at sites with and without control. Signs of social stability steadily increased the longer an area was allowed to recover from control, but change in abundance did not follow a consistent path. Comparison of abundance and stability among all sites and years demonstrated that control severely fractures social groups, but that the effect of control on abundance was neither consistent nor predictable. Management decisions involving large social predators must therefore consider social stability to ensure their conservation and ecological functioning.},

abstract = {Although females are the choosier sex in most species, male mate choice is expected to occur under certain conditions. Theoretically, males should prefer larger females as mates in species where female fecundity increases with body size. However, any fecundity-related benefits accruing to a male that has mated with a large female may be offset by an associated fitness cost of shared paternity if large females are more likely to be multiply mated than smaller females in nature. We tested the above hypothesis and assumption using the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) by behaviourally testing for male mate choice in the laboratory and by ascertaining (with the use of microsatellite DNA genotyping) patterns of male paternity in wild-caught females. We observed significant positive relationships between female body length and fecundity (brood size) and between body length and level of multiple paternity in the broods of females collected in the Quare´ River, Trinidad. In laboratory tests, a preference for the larger of two simultaneously-presented virgin females was clearly expressed only when males were exposed to the full range of natural stimuli from the females, but not when they were limited to visual stimuli alone. However, as suggested by our multiple paternity data, males that choose to mate with large females may incur a larger potential cost of sperm competition and shared paternity compared with males that mate with smaller females on average. Our results thus suggest that male guppies originating from the Quare´ River possess mating preferences for relatively large females, but that such preferences are expressed only when males can accurately assess the mating status of encountered females that differ in body size.},

abstract = {Many analytical techniques that assess resource selection focus on individual relocation points as the sample unit and classify resources as either used or available. Commonly, the relative use of each resource is quantified as the number of observations in each resource class or the proportional occurrence of a resource within a home range. We believe that a more accurate estimate can be summarized by a utilization distribution (UD). We present an analytical approach that explicitly incorporates a probabilistic measure of use, as defined by the UD. We used animal relocation points and fixed-kernel techniques to determine a UD within a home range. We related this probabilistic measure of use to,categorical and continuous resource variables using multiple regression. Regression errors accounted for spatial autocorrelation so that the significance of regression coefficients could be appraised for each animal and averaged across animals. This allowed us to quantify the individualistic nature of resource selection and test for consistency in use of resources by a population. Sample sizes in population assessments correctly reflected the individual animal as the experimental unit. We used this technique in a geographic information system setting to examine the importance of local-scale (forest cover) and landscape-scale (degree of fragmentation, proximity to edges and human use areas) attributes to breeding season habitat selection by 25 radio-tagged Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) in western Washington State, USA. Individual jays varied significantly in habitat use, but most (20) concentrated their use in areas with many vegetation patches or in areas with extensive edge between forest and nonforested land cover. This confirmed our prediction that jays prefer fragmented habitat and forest edges and helped to explain why jays are most abundant in fragmented landscapes. However, we refined our, understanding of why they used such habitats by demonstrating that landscape attributes. affected use of local habitat features:high-contrast edges were used most if they were associated with small human settlements and campgrounds. Use of patchy and edgy areas within home ranges may be reinforced by natural selection because jays that inhabited areas with complex-shaped patches and concentrated their activity in such areas were most likely to fledge young. Concentration of use along forest-human land use interfaces may explain the greater risk of nest predation to other birds in such settings.},

The variable overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), used in recent studies, combines the dynamic elements of acceleration recorded in all three dimensions to measure acceleration and hence energy expenditure due to body movement. However, the simplicity of ODBA affords it limitations. Furthermore, while accelerometry data loggers enable measures to be stored, recording at high frequencies represents a limit to deployment periods as a result of logger memory and/or battery exhaustion. Using bantam chickens walking at different speeds in a respirometer while wearing an accelerometer logger, we investigated the best proxies for rate of oxygen consumption ( ) from a range of different models V̇o2using acceleration. We also investigated the effects of sampling acceleration at different frequencies. The best predictor of was a multiple regression including individual measures of V̇o2dynamic acceleration in each of the three dimensions. However, R2was relatively high for ODBA as well and also for certain measures of dynamic acceleration in single dimensions. The aforementioned are single variables, therefore easily derived onboard a data logger and from which a simple calibration equation can be derived. For calibrations of against ODBA, R2V̇o2was consistent as sampling number decreased down to 600 samples of each acceleration channel per ODBA data point, beyond which R2 tended to be considerably lower.

For example, most turtles mature at around 70{\%} of maximum size, as do other reptiles. Adult lifespans are proportional to age at maturity, and the relationship between these two variables is similar in turtles to that documented in other reptiles. Although the ratio of the von Bertalanffy growth constant (k) to the adult instantaneous mortality rate (M) appears to be higher than ratios reported for other animals (including squamate reptiles), the general relationship between these two variables corresponds with that seen in other reptiles. These analyses show that turtles exhibit patterns of growth, survivorship and maturation that are of the same form as those that are present in other types of organisms in which growth continues after maturity.},

We developed a Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) for estimating the expected movement path of an animal, using discrete location data obtained at relatively short time intervals. The BBMM is based on the properties of a conditional random walk between successive pairs of locations, dependent on the time between locations, the distance between locations, and the Brownian motion variance that is related to the animal's mobility. We describe two critical developments that enable widespread use of the BBMM, including a derivation of the model when location data are measured with error and a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the Brownian motion variance. After the BBMM is fitted to location data, an estimate of the animal's probability of occurrence can be generated for an area during the time of observation. To illustrate potential applications, we provide three examples: estimating animal home ranges, estimating animal migration routes, and evaluating the influence of fine-scale resource selection on animal movement patterns.},

abstract = {Resource-selection probability functions and occupancy models are powerful methods of identifying areas within a landscape that are highly used by a species. One common design/analysis method for estimation of a resource-selection probability function is to classify a sample of units as used or unused and estimate the probability of use as a function of independent variables using, for example, logistic regression. This method requires that resource units are correctly classified as unused (i.e., the species is never undetected in a used unit), or that the probability of misclassification is the same for all units. In this paper, I explore these issues, illustrating how misclassifying units as unused may lead to incorrect conclusions about resource use. I also show how recently developed occupancy models can be utilized within the resource-selection context to improve conclusions by explicitly accounting for detection probability. These models require that multiple surveys be conducted at each of a sample of resource units within a relatively short timeframe, but given the growing evidence from simulation studies and field data, I recommend that such procedures should be incorporated into studies of resource use.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Central Africa is a "hotspot" for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of global and local importance, and a current outbreak of ebolavirus is affecting multiple countries simultaneously. Ebolavirus is suspected to have caused recent declines in resident great apes. While ebolavirus vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved if we could diagnostically confirm Ebola virus disease (EVD) as the cause of die-offs, establish ebolavirus geographical distribution, identify immunologically na{\"{i}}ve populations, and determine whether apes survive virus exposure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the first successful noninvasive detection of antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) from wild ape feces. Using this method, we have been able to identify gorillas with antibodies to EBOV with an overall prevalence rate reaching 10{\%} on average, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to EBOV (protected from exposure by rivers as topological barriers of transmission).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future EBOV infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically na{\"{i}}ve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Finally, since human EVD is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EBOV causes case-fatality rates of up to 88{\%}.},

abstract = {An animal's behaviour is a response to its environment and physiological condition, and$\backslash$nas such, gives vital clues as to its well-being, which is highly relevant in conservation issues. Behaviour can generally be typified by body motion and body posture, parameters that are both measurable using animal-attached accelerometers. Interpretation of acceleration data, however, can be complex, as the static (indicative of posture) and dynamic (motion) components are derived from the total acceleration values, which should ideally be recorded in all 3-dimensional axes. The principles of triaxial accelerometry are summarised and discussed in terms of the commonalities that arise in patterns$\backslash$nof acceleration across species that vary in body pattern, life-history strategy, and the medium they inhabit. Using tri-axial acceleration data from deployments on captive and free-living animals (n = 12 species), behaviours were identified that varied in complexity, from the rhythmic patterns of locomotion, to feeding, and more variable patterns including those relating to social interactions. These data can be combined with positional information to qualify patterns of area-use and map the$\backslash$ndistribution of target behaviours. The range and distribution of behaviour may also provide insight into the transmission of disease. In this way, the measurement of tri-axial acceleration can provide$\backslash$ninsight into individual and population level processes, which may ultimately influence the effectiveness of conservation practice},

The scansorial coati drop fruit whilst feeding that both collared peccaries and other coatis consume. Young coatis were also observed chewing on the pulp left over from seeds spat out by collared peccaries who had removed the hard exocarp. Both species react to each other's alarm calls. Peccaries also benefited from the fruits dropped by black howler monkeys. Ecologically, coatis are omnivores; but taxonomically, they are carnivores.

abstract = {The presence of domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in Brazilian protected areas is fairly frequent. The interaction of such dogs with native animals leads to population declines for many species, particularly carnivores. In this paper the main threats dogs bring about Brazilian biodiversity are assessed with a focus on protected areas. We collected information from papers on the interaction of dogs and wildlife species as well as from interviews with National Park managers. Studies in protected areas in Brazil listed 37 native species affected by the presence of dogs due to competition, predation, or pathogen transmission. Among the 69 threatened species of the Brazilian fauna, 55{\%} have been cited in studies on dogs. Dog occurrence was assessed for 31 National Parks in Brazil. The presence of human residents and hunters in protected areas were the factors most often quoted as facilitating dog occurrence. These may be feral, street or domestically owned dogs found in protected areas in urban, rural or natural areas. Effective actions to control this invasive alien species in natural areas must consider dog dependence upon humans, pathways of entry, and the surrounding landscape and context.},

More like snakes on legs, monstersaurs are a walking contradiction: they are venomous yet don't appear to use their venom for subduing prey; their mottled patterns mingle with the broken shadows and textures of their desert and tropical dry forest habitats, yet their bright open mouths hiss a bold warning that a nasty bite awaits those who advance further. And while Gila Monster venom produces excruciating pain, it also contains a peptide that has become a promising new drug for treating type-2 diabetes. Perhaps the ultimate paradox is that monstersaurs are among the most famous of lizards, yet until quite recently they have remained among the least studied. With numerous illustrations, stunning color photographs, and an up-to-date synthesis of their biology, this book explains why the Monstersauria seems poised to change the way we think about lizards. Daniel D. Beck—who has been investigating Gila Monsters and Beaded Lizards for over 22 years—teams up here with award-winning wildlife photographer Tom Wiewandt to produce a comprehensive summary of this small but remarkable family of lizards.},

abstract = {The utility of integrating remotely sensed data and other spatial information in a geographical information system (GIS) to model habitat suitability for nesting by saltwater crocodiles ( Crocodylus porosus) was investigated in this study. The study areas, Melacca Swamp and the Adelaide River wetlands, are located 50 km east of Darwin, Northern Territory, and encompass areas of suitable nesting habitat for C. porosus. Melacca Swamp is a highly productive nesting area and is managed as a conservation reserve to protect its nesting habitat. Landsat TM, SPOT satellite imagery and large-scale colour aerial photography were evaluated for their utility in mapping habitats preferred for nesting by C. porosus within Melacca Swamp. Satellite imagery was capable of identifying generalised habitat classes used for nesting ( e. g. open swamp with emergent trees). However, it was only with aerial photography that habitats could be discerned ( e. g. sedges with scattered Melaleuca trees). Spatial information derived from satellite imagery and other sources was integrated in a GIS to model potentially suitable nesting habitat along the Adelaide River. This methodology effectively identified known preferred nesting areas of C. porosus on the basis of the analysis of environmental parameters (i.e. distance to water, vegetation type) that have an influence on selection of nesting habitat. The findings of this research demonstrate the utility of remote sensing and GIS for mapping nesting habitat of C. porosus at a range of scales and provide guidelines for application of the approaches used at the regional or State level.},

abstract = {The establishment and reinforcement of dominance status is thought to provide an individual with increased access to preferred resources, such as food, mates, and shelter. Resources within an environment vary based on their availability, abundance, and specific characteristics of the resource. Animals can exhibit preferences for resources by increasing the intensity of competition for access to the resource. We investigated the role that dominance has in acquiring and controlling resources within crayfish populations. Populations of 5 size-matched crayfish were allowed to establish a social hierarchy in the presence of shelters of differing structure in 10 different trials. Crayfish agonistic interactions and the use and control of shelters were quantified from 96 h continuous video recordings. Shelter preference was defined by crayfish use of specific shelter types that were occupied for longer durations. Analysis of the social hierarchy demonstrated that crayfish have a linearity hierarchy in this context. In addition, it is clear that dominance rank had a significant impact on shelter use, shelter acquisition, and shelter eviction. Crayfish with lower average dominance ranks selected specific shelter types (smaller and fewer openings). Dominant crayfish used big shelters and were less likely to be evicted from shelters. These results demonstrate that dominance in crayfish serves a role in the acquisition of resources and is also important for the control of those resources.},

abstract = {Snake venom gene evolution has been studied intensively over the past several decades, yet most previous studies have lacked the context of complete snake genomes and the full context of gene expression across diverse snake tissues. We took a novel approach to studying snake venom evolution by leveraging the complete genome of the Burmese python, including information from tissue-specific patterns of gene expression.We identified the orthologs of snake venom genes in the python genome, and conducted detailed analysis of gene expression of these venom homologs to identify patterns that differ between snake venom gene families and all other genes. We found that venom gene homologs in the python are expressed in many different tissues outside of oral glands, which illustrates the pitfalls of using transcriptomic data alone to define “venom toxins.” We hypothesize that the python may represent an ancestral state prior to major venom development, which is supported by our finding that the expansion of venom gene families is largely restricted to highly venomous caenophidian snakes. Therefore, the python provides insight into biases in which genes were recruited for snake venom systems. Python venom homologs are generally expressed at lower levels, have higher variance among tissues, and are expressed in fewer organs compared with all other python genes. We propose a model for the evolution of snake venoms in which venom genes are recruited preferentially from genes with particular expression profile characteristics, which facilitate a nearly neutral transition toward specialized venom system expression.},

abstract = {Disease transmission parameters are the core of epidemic models, but are difficult to esti- mate, especially in the absence of outbreak data. Investigation of the roaming behaviour, home range (HR) and utilization distribution (UD) can provide the foundation for such parameter estimation in free-ranging animals. The objectives of this study were to estimate HR and UD of 69 domestic dogs in six Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in northern Australia and to compare four different methods (the minimum convex poly- gon, MCP; the location-based kernel density estimation, LKDE; the biased random bridge, BRB; and Time Local Convex Hull, T-LoCoH) for investigation of UD and estimating HR sizes. Global positioning system (GPS) collars were attached to community dogs for a period of 1–3 days and positions (fixes) were recorded every minute. Median core HRs (50{\%} iso- pleth) of the 69 dogs were estimated to range from 0.2 to 0.4 ha and the more extended HR (95{\%} isopleth) to range from 2.5 to 5.3 ha, depending on the method used. The HR and UD shapes were found to be generally circular around the dog owner's house. However, some individuals were found to roam much more with a HR size of 40–104 ha and cover large areas of their community or occasionally beyond. These far roaming dogs are of particular interest for infectious disease transmission. Occasionally, dogs were taken between com- munities and out of communities for hunting, which enables the contact of dogs between communities and with wildlife (such as dingoes). The BRB and T-LoCoH are the only two methods applied here which integrate the consecutiveness of GPS locations into the anal- ysis, a substantial advantage. The recently developed BRB method produced significantly larger HR estimates than the other two methods; however, the variability of HR sizes was lower compared to the other methods. Advantages of the BRB method include a more real- istic analytical approach (kernel density estimation based on movements rather than on locations), possibilities to deal with irregular time periods between consecutive GPS fixes and parameter specification which respects the characteristics of the GPS unit used to col- lect the data. The BRB method was therefore the most suitable method for UD estimation in this dataset. The results of this study can further be used to contact rates between the dogs within and between communities, a foundation for estimating transmission parameters for canine infectious disease models, such as a rabies spread model in Australia.

abstract = {Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of animals in the wild would revolutionize our ability to study and conserve ecosystems. We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could transform many fields of biology, ecology, and zoology into "big data" sciences. Motion sensor "camera traps" enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2-million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with over 93.8{\%} accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3{\%} of the data while still performing at the same 96.6{\%} accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving more than 8.4 years (at 40 hours per week) of human labeling effort (i.e. over 17,000 hours) on this 3.2-million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains immediately highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images. Our results suggest that this technology could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.},

abstract = {Predation on eggs is an important source of mortality for many long-lived organisms, but causes of egg mortality from specific predators remain poorly known in most cases. Understanding the identity of predators, and the rates and determinants of their effects on a cohort of recruits, can provide a valuable background for attempts to exploit, control or conserve populations. We used remotely triggered cameras to study predation on the nests of freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni) inhabiting Lake Argyle, in tropical Australia. We also supplemented our work on natural crocodile nests with artificial nests. Overall, 80 of 111 natural nests were opened by predators, and predation occurred throughout the study period (7 weeks). Unlike in other parts of the species' range, most nest-robbers were dingoes (Canis lupus dingo, responsible for 98{\%} of all predator visits in the northern sites, and 54{\%} in the Ord River site), with minimal additional predation by reptiles and birds. Contrary to expectation, rates of nest predation were not influenced by spatial clumping of nests: the probability of predation per nest did not change with total numbers of nests laid in an area, and artificially aggregated versus dispersed nests experienced similar levels of predation. Nest vulnerability was linked to abiotic features including slope of surrounding banks, compactness of nesting substrate, and distance from the nearest forest. Abundant aquatic food resources support a large crocodile population, but a lack of suitable nest-sites forces the crocodiles to concentrate nesting in small areas readily accessible to wide-ranging nest predators. Collectively, our results suggest that distinctive attributes of the lakeside landscape alter predator guilds and fashion unique predator-prey interactions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {1. Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. 2. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objec- tives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analyti- cal assumptions and species ecology. 3. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence–absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. 4. Most studies estimating density used capture–recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abun- dance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between mea- sured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). 5. Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting tran- sition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology's promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, move- ment and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliabil- ity of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet mod- ern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.},

abstract = {Quantifying the behavior of motile, free-ranging animals is difficult. The accelerometry technique offers a method for recording behaviors but interpreta- tion of the data is not straightforward. To date, analysis of such data has either involved subjective, study-specific assignments of behavior to acceleration data or the use of complex analyses based on machine learning. Here, we present a method for automatically classifying acceleration data to represent discrete, coarse-scale behaviors. The method centers on examining the shape of his- tograms of basic metrics readily derived from acceleration data to objectively determine threshold values by which to separate behaviors. Through application of this method to data collected on two distinct species with greatly differing behavioral repertoires, kittiwakes, and humans, the accuracy of this approach is demonstrated to be very high, comparable to that reported for other automated approaches already published. The method presented offers an alternative to existing methods as it uses biologically grounded arguments to distinguish behaviors, it is objective in determining values by which to separate these behaviors, and it is simple to implement, thus making it potentially widely applicable. The R script coding the method is provided.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: The use of accelerometers in bio-logging devices has proved to be a powerful tool for the quantification of animal behaviour. While bio-logging techniques are being used on wide range of species, to date they have only been seldom used with non-human primates. This is likely due to three main factors: the long tradition of direct field observations, a difficulty of attaching bio-logging devices to wild primates and the challenge of deciphering acceleration signals in species' with remarkable locomotor and behavioural diversity. Here, we overcome these aforementioned obstacles and provide methodology for identification of behaviours from accelerometer data of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in Cape Town, South Africa. Results: We apply machine learning techniques to process complex accelerometer data, collected by bespoke tracking collars to quantify a range of behaviours (focusing on locomotion and foraging behaviour). We successfully identify six broad state behaviours that represent 93.3{\%} of the time budget of the baboons. Resting, walking, running and foraging were all identified with high recall and precision representing the first classification of multiple behavioural states from accelerometer data for a wild primate. Conclusion: Our 'end to end' process-from collar design and build to the collection and quantification of acceleration data-provides advantages over gathering data by traditional observation, not least because it affords data collection without the presence of an observer which may affect an animal's behaviour. Furthermore, our methodology and findings open new possibilities for the fine-scale study of movement and foraging ecology in wild primates, and in particular our baboon study population which is in conflict with people.},

abstract = {Ecology of a bird community was studied in the Sungei Mandai mangrove forest in Singapore from May to July 1996. We found a total of 42 bird species in the forest. Based on the spot- mapping, the most abundant bird species in the forest was the Black-naped Oriole (Oriolus chinensis). With 168 mist-netting hours, we captured 15 bird species. The most common bird species mist-netted was the Asian Glossy Starling (Aplonis panayensis). We also recorded two locally-threatened bird species in the area, the White chested Babbler (Trichastoma rostratum) and Oriental Magpie Robin (Copsychus saularis). The bird community composition of this area is comparable to a similar site in Singapore (the Sungei Buloh Nature Park). We recorded seven bird species possibly breeding in the area. However, due to the limited survey time, this number most probably is an underestimation. Preliminary foraging observations of six bird species were made in the area. Based on a cluster analysis in which we used 20 foraging-related characteristics (e.g., frequency use of different plant species), we found that leaf-gleaners (the Dark-necked Tailorbird Orthotomus atrogularis, Common Iora Aegithina tiphia, and Pied Triller Lalage nigra) were similar in their overall foraging activities. These leaf-gleaners were different in overall foraging activities from the species that frequently foraged on aerial insects (Pied Fantail Rhipidura javanica), that predominantly found prey off the bark of trees (Common Goldenback Dinopium javanense), or that primarily foraged from flowers (Olive-backed Sunbird Nectarinia jugularis).},

abstract = {Noninvasive camera-traps are commonly used to survey mammal communities in the Neotropics. This study used camera-traps to survey medium and large mammal diversity in the San Juan – La Selva Biological Corridor, Costa Rica. The connectivity of the corridor is affected by the spread of large-scale agriculture, cattle ranching, and a growing human presence. An occupancy modeling approach was used to estimate corridor species richness and species-specific detection probabilities in 16 forested sites within four different matrix-use categories: eco-lodge reserves, tree plantations/general reforestation, cattle ranches, and pineapple/agricultural plantations. Rarity had a highly negative effect ($\beta$ = -1.96 ± 0.65 SE) on the ability to detect species presence. Corridor richness was estimated at 20.4 ± 0.66 species and was lower than that observed in protected areas in the Neotropics. Forest cover was significantly less at pineapple plantations than other land-use matrices. Richness estimates for different land-use matrices were highly variable with no significant differences; however, pineapple plantations exhibited the highest observed richness. Given the limited forest cover at those sites, we believe that this reflects the concentrated occurrence of medium and large mammals in small forest patches, particularly because the majority of pineapple plantation communities were generalist mesopredators. Fragmentation and connectivity will need to be addressed with reforestation and limitations on pineapple production for the region to function as an effective corridor. Occupancy modeling has only recently been applied to camera-trap data and our results suggest that this approach provides robust richness and detection probability estimates and should be further explored.

abstract = {Migration rates among nine populations of the endemic Lake Malawi cichlid Melanochromis auratus were estimated along a 42-km stretch of habitat in the southern end of the lake. Allele frequencies were surveyed at four simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. The data suggest migration rates among populations are quite low. Exact tests indicate that statistically detectable allele frequency differences exist between many adjacent populations in the study. The Fs, value among all populations was estimated to be 0.151 (P {\textless} 0.0002). A biogeographic survey suggests that the highest levels of genetic differentiation exist between populations separated by stretches of deep water. Migration is more common between populations separated by shallower water or with shoreline dispersal routes. Reduced allelic diversity was observed at more recently created habitat patches, suggesting that either bottlenecks are associated with the colonization of new habitat patches or that these shallower sites were all founded by genetically depauperate ancestral populations. The extreme philopatry of M. auratus, coupled with the patchy distribution and transient nature of its preferred habitat, provides opportunities for both selection and genetic drift to produce genetic differentiation among populations. Both processes may be important to the evolution of taxonomic diversity in the East African cichlid species flocks. [References: 47]},

These collapses in top predator populations are commonly associated with dramatic increases in the abundance of smaller predators. Known as “mesopredator release,” this trophic interaction has been recorded across a range of communities and ecosystems. Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions. We present an overview of mesopredator release and illustrate how its underlying concepts can be used to improve predator management in an increasingly fragmented world. We also examine shifts in North American carnivore ranges during the past 200 years and show that 60{\%} of mesopredator ranges have expanded, whereas all apex predator ranges have contracted. The need to understand how best to predict and manage mesopredator release is urgent—mesopredator outbreaks are causing high ecological, economic, and social costs around the world.},

These repeated transitions make squamates an outstanding/excellent system for addressing many fundamental questions in evolutionary biology. For example, they are the only vertebrate group with true parthenogenesis (with at least 40 separate origins), they have more origins of viviparity than any other group of vertebrates, and they have undergone dramatic changes in body form (lizard-like to snake-like) dozens of times. New molecular phylogenies for squamates have overturned many traditional hypotheses and taxonomies based on morphology and are now revealing exciting new insights into the evolution of many of these traits at both higher and lower taxonomic levels.

abstract = {Studies about the movement of mammals have recently gained much emphasis thanks to the development of new tracking technology, allowing highly accurate recording of animal movement. However, the amount of data made available requires effective theoretical and analytical framework for appropriate scientific use, i.e. to answer questions of interest. Within this review, we used systematic reviewing technique and the movement ecology framework to assess current knowledge and gaps in wild boar Sus scrofa spatial behaviour, species of high economic, ecological and social interest. Specifically, we observed that the development of new tracking techniques (radio-telemetry and global positioning system) has promoted movement-related studies since the early 2000. However, the ecology of movement, i.e. the why, how, when and where exactly an individual is moving is rarely the focus of these studies, which instead lies in the consequences of wild boar movement, e.g. the spread of disease, seed dispersal or damage. Most of the current studies are thus concerned with the interaction between environmental factors and spatial behaviour of the species, while other components of movement, internal state, navigation, and motion capacity are seldom studied. Compared to others ungulates, we also observed that wild boar movement ecology is still poorly considered in the literature. This review highlights the need for more quantitative descriptions of movement and behavioural-based approaches relating wild boar movement to its internal, navigational, and motion capacities. We expect that facilitated access to tracking technologies, in terms of cost and miniaturization, along with current interest in movement ecology will greatly promote increased knowledge in wild boar spatial behaviour.},

abstract = {Olfactory stimuli are known to alter the labile phase status of polymorphic locusts. This study looked at the way in which the gregarization pheromone, found in the faeces of crowd-reared nymphs, is perceived by nymphs of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. It was necessary to expose isolated-reared nymphs to this stimulus for 7 days in order to see changes towards values typical of crowded locusts in nymphal social behaviour and body colour. Antennaeless nymphs were unable to perceive the stimulus. Faeces from crowd-reared adults, however, had an opposite effect; previously crowded nymphs, on isolation, lost their tendency to form social groups faster than controls, when exposed to the faeces of adult locusts. This solitarizing stimulus had an effect in 4 days. The stimulus was not strong enough to overcome the gregarizing effect of rearing nymphs in pairs. An experiment was carried out to discover if the antennae were also the organs of perception of the solitarizing stimulus. This was confounded by the fact that amputation of the antennae had a short-term solitarizing effect which masked the role of the antennae in perception of the solitarizing stimulus of the adult faeces.},

abstract = {Large carnivores can either directly influence ungulate populations or indirectly affect their behaviour. Knowledge from European systems, in contrast to North American systems, on how this might lead to cascading effects on lower trophic levels is virtually absent. We studied whether wolves Canis lupus via density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects on their ungulate prey species influence patterns of browsing and tree regeneration inside the Bia{\l}owie{\.{z}}a National Park, Poland. Browsing intensity of tree saplings (height class {\textless} 150 cm), irrespective of tree species or forest type, was lower inside a wolf core area (50.5{\%}) where predator presence is highest, than in the remainder of the wolf pack's home range (58.3{\%}). Additionally, browsing intensity was reduced when the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), which can act as a ʻungulate escape impedimentʼ, increased (within 5-m radius) inside the wolf core area. No relationship existed outside the core area. As a result, the proportion of trees growing out of herbivore control increased more strongly with increasing amount of CWD inside compared to outside the wolf core area. This suggests that next to direct effects of wolves on ungulate density caused by a higher predation pressure inside the core area, risk effects are important and are enhanced by habitat characteristics. These results indicate that behaviorally-mediated effects of predators on prey can become more important than density-mediated effects in affecting lower trophic levels. This is the first study we are aware of, that shows CWD can create fine-scale risk effects on ungulates with the potential for cascading effects of large predators on patterns of tree regeneration for a European forest system. This knowledge broadens the discussion on how the impact of large predators on ecosystem functioning depends on the physical landscape, by illustrating these effects for a system which largely contrasts in this respect to the North American systems.},

abstract = {Alien predators can have catastrophic effects on ecosystems and are thought to be much more harmful to biodiversity than their native counterparts. However, trophic cascade theory and the mesopredator release hypothesis predict that the removal of top predators will result in the reorganization of trophic webs and loss of biodiversity. Using field data collected throughout arid Australia, we provide evidence that removal of an alien top-predator, the dingo, has cascading effects through lower trophic levels. Dingo removal was linked to increased activity of herbivores and an invasive mesopredator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and to the loss of grass cover and native species of small mammals. Using species distribution data, we predict that reintroducing or maintaining dingo populations would produce a net benefit for the conservation of threatened native mammals across greater than 2.42 x 10(6) km(2) of Australia. Our study provides evidence that an alien top predator can assume a keystone role and be beneficial for biodiversity conservation, and also that mammalian carnivores more generally can generate strong trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {Mass mortality events (MMEs) are rapidly occurring catastrophic demographic events that punctuate background mortality levels. Individual MMEs are staggering in their observed magnitude: re- moving more than 90{\%} of a population, resulting in the death of more than a billion individuals, or producing 700 million tons of dead biomass in a single event. Despite extensive documentation of individual MMEs, we have no understanding of themajor features characterizing the occurrence and magnitude of MMEs, their causes, or trends through time. Thus, no framework exists for contextualizing MMEs in the wake of ongoing global and regional perturbations to natural systems. Herewe present an analysis of 727 publishedMMEs from across the globe, affecting 2,407 animal populations. We show that the magnitude of MMEs has been intensifying for birds, fishes, andmarine invertebrates; invariant for mammals; and decreasing for reptiles and amphibians. These shifts in magnitude proved robust when we accounted for an increase in the occurrence of MMEs since 1940. However, it remains unclear whether the increase in the occurrence ofMMEs represents a true pattern or simply a perceived increase. Regardless, the increase inMMEs appears to be associated with a rise in disease emergence, biotoxicity, and events produced bymultiple interacting stressors, yet temporal trends inMME causes varied among taxa and may be associated with increased de- tectability. In addition, MMEs with the largest magnitudes were those that resulted from multiple stressors, starvation, and disease. These results advance our understanding of rare demographic processes and their relationship to global and regional perturba- tions to natural systems.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {1. Dogs Canis familiaris are the world's most common carnivore and are known to interact with wildlife as predators, prey, competitors, and disease reservoirs or vectors. 2. Despite these varied roles in the community, the interaction of dogs with sympatric wild carnivore species is poorly understood. We review how dogs have been classified in the literature, and illustrate how the location and ranging behaviour of dogs are important factors in predicting their interactions with wild prey and carnivores. 3. We detail evidence of dogs as intraguild competitors with sympatric carnivores in the context of exploitative, interference and apparent competition. 4. Dogs can have localized impacts on prey populations, but in general they are not exploit- ative competitors with carnivores. Rather, most dog populations are highly dependent on human-derived food and gain a relatively small proportion of their diet from wild prey. However, because of human-derived food subsidies, dogs can occur at high population densities and thus could potentially outcompete native carnivores, especially when prey is limited. 5. Dogs can be effective interference competitors, especially with medium-sized and small carnivores. Dogs may fill the role of an interactive medium-sized canid within the carnivore community, especially in areas where the native large carnivore community is depauperate. 6. Dogs can also be reservoirs of pathogens, because most populations around the world are free-ranging and unvaccinated. Diseases such as rabies and canine distemper have resulted in severe population declines in several endangered carnivores coexisting with high-density dog populations. Dogs can therefore be viewed as pathogen-mediated apparent competitors, capable of facilitating large-scale population declines in carnivores. 7. Based on this information, we propose conceptual models that use dog population size and ranging patterns to predict the potential for dogs to be intraguild competitors.Wediscuss how interactions between dogs and carnivores might influence native carnivore communities.},

abstract = {Reactive movement responses of prey are affected by habitat characteristics, such as cover, which determine predation risk. Open habitats with low cover facilitate predator detection, movement and escape, while closed habitats reduce the ability to detect predators and hinder movement. We performed a field experiment using nonlethal predators to study the reactive movement responses of medium-sized prey in patches with different vegetation characteristics related to elevated predation risk. Ten GPS-collared, free-ranging European hares, Lepus europaeus, were repeatedly subjected to a leashed dog and two humans in an experimental cross-over design. Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of the treatment and its interaction with vegetation parameters on the movement behaviour of the European hare. The reactive movement response was best explained by the model that included the interaction between elevated predation risk and vegetation structure. A strong immediate response was found in short vegetation up to 1 h after the treatment ended. The effect extended beyond the duration of the treatment and was synchronized with the resting and foraging period over the next 24 h. The distance covered between resting and foraging grounds was negatively affected, while use of less risky, low-quality vegetation during resting and foraging was favoured. Medium-sized prey species exhibit strong behavioural responses to the perceived predation risk, which we demonstrate here for the European hare. An elevated predation risk, for example by dogs, can trigger costly behavioural responses in these medium-sized prey species.},

abstract = {Top-predators can play important roles in terrestrial food webs, fuelling speculation that top-predators might be used as biocontrol tools against invasive mesopredators. Feral cats are believed to be largely responsible for the current declines of native fauna across tropical northern Australia, where substantial beef cattle production occurs. Dingoes are known to impact cattle production there and are predicted to impact native fauna also. However, dingoes are forecasted to curtail the impacts of cats and reverse native fauna declines. We review (1) empirical studies investigating the relationships between dingoes and cats, and dingo control and cats, (2) records of cat remains in dingo diets, and (3) historical records of lethal dingo control using 1080-poisoned baits across Australia between 1999 and 2008 to show how two naturalised invasive species can interact in dynamic agro-ecological landscapes. From the 35 studies assessed, most reported no detectable relationship between dingoes and cats; negative or positive relationships were seldom detected. Dingoes do not appear to exclude cats beyond fine scales, but may alter cat activity periods under certain conditions. Cat remains were found in only 0.63{\%} of over 31,000 dingo diet records. Lethal dingo control occurs (in varying degrees) across about two-thirds of Australia and does not appear to substantially influence dingo-cat relationships. We conclude that the presently available data provides little evidence that bolstering dingo populations will reduce the impacts of cats. Much more work is needed to identify situations where top-predators might be used as effective biocontrol tools against invasive mesopredators in agro-ecological systems.},

We collected data for 2 years at 93 study sites along 3 transects of urbanization using motion-triggered cameras. Our primary objective was to determine the relationship among coyote and deer spatial and temporal distribution, habitat characteristics, and human activity using multi-season patch occupancy models. Coyote occupancy was most strongly linked to rates of site visitation by humans and dogs, and was more likely farther from the urban center, with coyote colonization of sites inversely related to road density, housing density, and human and dog site visitation. Deer more frequently occupied sites with high canopy cover near water sources and colonized smaller sites with reduced housing density and human and dog presence. Expected predator–prey dynamics were altered in this highly urban system. Though we predicted deer would avoid coyotes on the landscape based on an “ecology of fear” framework, deer and coyote occupancy showed a strong positive association. We suggest that a scarcity of quality habitat in urban areas may cause the species to co-occupy habitat despite potential fawn predation. Modifying human foot traffic in green spaces may represent a useful tool for management and conservation of large urban mammals.},

    Surplus killing (i.e. predation in which predators kill more prey than necessary to satiate their hunger) appears to be widespread in carnivores and has the potential to exacerbate human–carnivore conflict. Nevertheless, little is known about the frequency of surplus killing or about its impact on livestock.
    We review the information available on surplus killing by pumas Puma concolor and use data from central Argentina to quantify its impact on ranching and to analyse both its causes and its implications for puma–human conflicts.
    We reviewed 73 publications and found nine mentions of surplus killing events from six countries. The sheep was by far the most commonly affected livestock species. In central Argentina, surplus killing was reported by 25–33{\%} of the ranchers. In this region, the number of livestock killed during each event ranged from seven to 160 (median = 23) for the literature reports and from two to 70 (median = 7) in the records we personally collated. The number of individual animals killed per event was greater for interview‐based second‐hand reports than for first‐hand reports and verified events.
    Our results indicate that although surplus killing by pumas is uncommonly reported in the literature, it may be locally recurrent. Although surplus killing may be overestimated in interview‐based reports, it can produce significant losses for sheep and goat ranchers, may strongly exacerbate puma–human conflicts, and should be considered in puma–human conflict mitigation strategies.
    Ranchers typically attributed surplus killing to female pumas teaching kittens to hunt. However, there is little evidence supporting this interpretation. Surplus killing by pumas may be more likely to occur in situations where the predator's ‘normal' hunting sequence is disrupted by the accessibility of large numbers of easy prey. Confinement, stormy weather and poor antipredator behaviour may favour the occurrence of surplus killing events on livestock.

abstract = {Abstract. Most ecosystems have multiple predator species that not only compete for shared prey, but also pose direct threats to each other. These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild pr{\'{e}}dation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.},

abstract = {Life-history trade-offs between components of fitness arise because reproduction entails both gains and costs. Costs of reproduction can be divided into ecological and physiological costs. The latter have been rarely studied yet are probably a dominant component of the effect. A deeper understanding of life-history evolution will only come about once these physiological costs are better understood. Physiological costs may be direct or indirect. Direct costs include the energy and nutrient demands of the reproductive event, and the morphological changes that are necessary to facilitate achieving these demands. Indirect costs may be optional 'compensatory costs' whereby the animal chooses to reduce investment in some other aspect of its physiology to maximize the input of resource to reproduction. Such costs may be distinguished from consequential costs that are an inescapable consequence of the reproductive event. In small mammals, the direct costs of reproduction involve increased energy, protein and calcium demands during pregnancy, but most particularly during lactation. Organ remodelling is necessary to achieve the high demands of lactation and involves growth of the alimentary tract and associated organs such as the liver and pancreas. Compensatory indirect costs include reductions in thermogenesis, immune function and physical activity. Obligatory consequential costs include hyperthermia, bone loss, disruption of sleep patterns and oxidative stress. This is unlikely to be a complete list. Our knowledge of these physiological costs is currently at best described as rudimentary. For some, we do not even know whether they are compensatory or obligatory. For almost all of them, we have no idea of exact mechanisms or how these costs translate into fitness trade-offs.},

These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: {\^{a}}€{\oe}fixed sphere-of-influence,{\^{a}}€  or {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} of each reference point), and an {\^{a}}€{\oe}adaptive sphere-of-influence,{\^{a}}€  or {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), and compare them to the original {\^{a}}€{\oe}fixed-number-of-points,{\^{a}}€  or {\textless}italic{\textgreater}k{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}k{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH is generally superior to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}k{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}- and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at {\textless}ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu" xlink:type="simple"{\textgreater}http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Observing two groups of the lion-tailed macaque at Nelliyampathy and Andiparai forests of the Western Ghats of India, we asked whether the lion-tailed macaque associations with the sympatric Nilgiri langur and bonnet macaque were by chance or had any biological significance. Employing ‘all occurrences' sampling, we recorded an association if a group of another primate species came within 30 m of the focal group of the lion-tailed macaque. Date, time, associating species, activity of the study species and of the associating species, type of interaction, aggressor and the recipient, species displaced and duration of the association were recorded. We used the Waser gas model to calculate the expected frequency and duration of associations and compared them with the observed associations. The lion-tailed macaque spent less time in associations than expected. The lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur initiated associations less often, and remained in association for less time, than expected by chance. Whereas the expected and observed initiation of associations between the lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur in Nelliyampathy was significantly different (expected rate = 153; observed rate = 64), in Andiparai, it was not (expected rate = 55.5; observed rate = 61). The expected and observed association duration was significantly different in Nelliyampathy (expected duration = 54 min; observed duration = 15 min) and Andiparai (expected duration = 48 min; observed duration = 19 min). In contrast, we detected few differences between observed and expected association frequency for the lion-tailed macaque and the bonnet macaque. Aggressive interactions were common in areas where density of the Nilgiri langur groups was high. This is the first study on Asian primates using the ideal gas approach to show that primates do not form active associations with each other.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The mouse-deer was thought to be nocturnal, but diurnal distance moved per hour and behaviors observed directly in wild mouse-deer indicated that they were mainly active during the day and rested at night. Active individuals foraging or moving from shelter to shelter were mainly observed during the day, and inactive individuals resting on open forest floor were mainly observed during the night. Captive mouse-deer observed in a farm enclosure (1.5 ha in size) also showed activities similar to those observed in the forest. Radiotracking for 24 h revealed that mouse-deer significantly preferred crown-gap areas with dense undergrowth of creeping bamboo (Dinochloa) during the day but that they tended to move to the higher and drier ridge areas at night. These results indicated that mouse-deer used crown-gap areas as foraging sites and ridge areas as resting sites. Our results strongly suggest that mouse-deer use food resources in gap areas in tropical forests.},

We experimentally tested whether introducing trained Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) through falconry could be an effective management tool to reduce nuisance Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca). We hypothesized that falconry would result in elevated fear responses of geese, resulting in increased vigilance, reduced favorability of the site, and locally reduced abundance.Weconducted our study on 3 golf courses (1 treatment and 2 controls) in the Western Cape, South Africa, where Egyptian geese are a pest species. Our treatment involved flying the Harris's hawk directly at geese from golf carts. We monitored vigilance and goose numbers before, during, and after treatment. Goose vigilance at the treatment site increased by 76{\%} and abundance declined by 73{\%} following falconry. We did not observe changes at either control site.Although the hawks killed some geese, the decreases in abundance were almost 3 times greater than the numbers killed, indicating that indirect effects were considerably larger than the direct effect of mortality. During the treatment period, vigilance rates were greater in the presence of a golf cart, suggesting that geese learned to associate carts with the threat of predation. Post-treatment vigilance rates were significantly less than rates detected during the treatment period and goose abundance on the experimental site increased rapidly post-treatment, returning to pre- treatment rates within 2 months. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of falconry to reduce nuisance bird abundance and suggest there may be other applications where the deployment of trained predators can be used to mitigate negative human-wildlife interactions.},

abstract = {Any pet store in North America has a plethora of reptiles for sale. Most of these are terrestrial. However, there are a few available that must be maintained in aquatic or semiaquatic environments. Some species such as crocodilians and the larger aquatic chelonians, as well as the pelagic or marine reptiles, should be maintained at zoological parks and aquaria. Pet reptiles are those that can be maintained in glass aquaria in home table top environments. Aquatic reptiles, by the nature of their environment-water-are more difficult to keep in a homoeostatic environment. Maintaining pristine water quality is difficult because of rapid changes in the pH, increases in nitrogen levels, and algae production in the home aquarium. Most of the species do not consume all that they are offered to eat, and that excess food along with the feces produced can rapidly change the water quality. The species of aquatic reptiles most commonly kept in captivity are the following chelonians; red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), Eastern spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), diamond-backed terrapin (Malaclemmys terrapin), Blandling's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii), painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), cooter (Pseudemys floridana), wood turtle (Clemmys insculpata), and Western pond turtle (Clemmys marmorata). Rarely seen anymore in a home environment are crocodilians such as caimans and alligators. These species can be aggressive, rapidly outgrow a small aquarium, and, due to the growth rate, be difficult to feed regularly. Due to these factors, crocodilians should only be kept by expert biologists at reputable zoological parks and aquaria. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study of habitat selection and habitat use are crucial for understanding the biological requirements of animals and the strategies they use to fulfil their needs. A variety of statistical techniques are available to quantify habitat selection, most of them based on the comparison of habitat attributes in sites used by the animals and in unused, but available, sites. Because of the difficulties in defining what is available from an animal's perspective for many species, statistical approaches such as first-passage time (FPT) analysis have been developed, which explore habitat-use intensities through the areas used by animals. In this study, we expand on that approach by using FPT-derived data within the framework of mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models (CPH models) to quantify habitat selection. By modelling FPTs, CPH models evaluate which habitat attributes best explain the 'risk' or 'hazard' of the animal leaving an area of a given radius. For quantitative interpretations, the coefficients of the CPH model can be used to calculate hazard ratios that estimate relative habitat preferences: the lower the hazard ratio (i.e. the lower the risk of leaving), the higher the preference. Accounting for individual variability in habitat use by means of a random-effect term added to CPH models provides inferences that more appropriately reflect the typical hierarchical structure of telemetric data on animal space use. Synthesis and applications. In addition to providing inferences about habitat selection based on the estimated parameters, survival functions of fixed-effects CPH models can be used to construct spatial predictions, for instance maps of population-level space use. Such predictions can be particularly useful for applied purposes, for example as a basis for species conservation plans and reserve selection. The method is illustrated using two data sets from marine mammal species: ringed seals Phoca hispida and white whales Delphinapterus leucas, but it is broadly applicable to habitat selection and prediction studies of other highly mobile animals in marine or terrestrial systems.},

abstract = {Apex predators performimportant functions that regulate ecosystems world- wide. However, little is known about howecosystem regulation by predators is influenced by human activities. In particular, how important are top-down effects of predators relative to direct and indirect human-mediated bottom-up and top-downprocesses?Combining data on species' occurrence fromcamera traps and hunting records, we aimed to quantify the relative effects of top- down and bottom-up processes in shaping predator and prey distributions in a human-dominated landscape in Transylvania, Romania. By global standards this system is diverse, including apex predators (brown bear and wolf ), mesopredators (red fox) and large herbivores (roe and red deer). Humans and free-ranging dogs represent additional predators in the system. Using structural equation modelling, we found that apex predators suppress lower trophic levels, especially herbivores. However, direct and indirect top- down effects of humans affected the ecosystem more strongly, influencing species at all trophic levels. Our study highlights the need to explicitly embed humans and their influences within trophic cascade theory. This will greatly expand our understanding of species interactions in human-modified landscapes, which compose the majority of the Earth's terrestrial surface.},

abstract = {Relative abundance indices are often used to compare species abundance between sites. The indices assume that species have similar detection probabilities, or that differences between detection probabilities are known and can be corrected for. Indices often consist of encounter frequencies of footprints, burrows, markings or photo captures along trails or transect lines, but the assumption of equal detection probabilities is rarely validated. This study analyses detection probabilities of a range of Neotropical mammals on trails in dense secondary forest, using camera-trap and track data. Photo captures of the two large cats, jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor), were correlated solely with trail variables, while photo captures of their potential prey species had no correlation or negative correlation with trail variables. The Neotropical mammals varied greatly in their tendency to follow or cross trails based on footprints surveys. This indicates that camera locations on trails will have varying detection probability for these Neotropical mammals. Even the two similar-sized jaguars and pumas, occupying relatively similar niches, differed subtly in their use of trails. Pumas followed trails more completely while jaguars were more likely to deviate from trails. The ecological significance of these findings is that jaguars seem to be more willing to use the forest matrix away from trails than are pumas. We conclude that trail-based indices, such as photographic captures or tracks along trails, are not appropriate for comparison between Neotropical species, and not even between relatively similar species like jaguars and pumas.},

abstract = {“Home range” is a standard concept in animal ecology and behavior but few people try to understand what home ranges mean to the animals that have them and often assume that a home-range estimate, quantified using some method, is the home range. This leads to 2 problems. First, researchers put much energy into discerning and using the “best” methods for estimating home ranges while no one understands, really, what a home range is. Second, maps delineating home-range estimates may have little connection with what home ranges are and what they mean to the animals that have them. To gain insight into these problems, Roger Powell (hereafter, Roger) documented his own use of space for 65 days, obtaining complete data on where he went, what he did, and how much energy and money he expended and gained in each place. Roger's use of space is consistent with how other mammals use space and, therefore, examination of his data provides insight into what a home range is and how ecologists should approach quantifying other animals' home ranges. We present estimates of Roger's home range in 5 different metrics, or currencies, that provide important and different insights. Home-range estimators that combine different types of information to estimate the spatial distribution and qualities of resources that structure animal behavior (i.e., fitness surfaces) will probably provide the most insight into animals' home ranges. To make reasonable estimates of home ranges, researchers must collect data on habitat, resources, and other attributes of the landscape, so that they can understand basic behaviors of animals and understand how animals may view their environment. We propose that the best concept of a home range is that part of an animal's cognitive map of its environment that it chooses to keep updated.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs are the most abundant carnivores worldwide, primarily due to human support. Food and other subsidies to dogs do not necessarily prevent dog predation on wildlife, particularly where dogs are allowed to range freely. Dog impacts on wildlife are suspected to be significant, yet the nature of dog-wildlife interactions is not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of dogs can significantly influence the space use of potential prey, and that both lethal and non-lethal mechanisms may underlie this interaction. If this is true, then we predicted that (1) evidence of predation and harassment by dogs should be evident where prey and dog activities overlap and (2) potential prey should be less frequent in areas where the probability of dog presence is high. To test these predictions we conducted two related studies. (1) We interviewed dog owners to estimate the probability of dog attack on pudu (Pudu puda), a globally vulnerable deer, and the lethality of these attacks. (2) We conducted a camera-trap survey documenting the landscape-scale distribution of pudu and dogs. Interviews showed that both the probability of dog attack on pudu ({\textgreater}85{\%}) and the lethality of such attacks was high (50{\%}). In occupancy models applied to the camera-trap data, the variable that best explained the distribution of pudus was the probability of dog presence. We tested three alternative explanations for the negative association between pudus and dogs that were not supported. Our findings suggest that dogs are efficient at chasing pudu they detect and that both predation and non-lethal (avoidance) consequences of harassment may be shaping the distribution of pudu. This work brings into focus important mechanisms underlying the threats of domestic dogs to endangered prey. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Despite domestic dogs being widespread there is little information on the scale and scope of any conservation problems they may cause. Dog management is already carried out by human health and welfare groups in order to improve welfare and reduce disease spread, primarily rabies. By reviewing information about interactions between dogs and wildlife, this paper aims to provide a clear summary of current knowledge and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration between conservation biologists and other experts.Data from dog population and human population studies indicate that the global domestic dog population abundance is over 700 million. Studies on interactions between free-roaming dogs and wildlife were gathered from searches of seven online databases and other sources. In total, 69 peer-reviewed studies were found. The wildlife taxon mainly studied was mammals (78{\%}) and the main interaction recorded was predation by domestic dogs, followed by disease transmission, wildlife disturbance, hybridization and predation of dogs by wild carnivores. Conservation issues with domestic dogs were recorded from around the world, both on islands and continents. Suggestions of solutions were limited, or not offered, beyond extermination which, given the close relationship between local people and dogs, may not often be appropriate. We propose some steps that will aid cooperation between conservationists and other sectors and enhance the effectiveness of conservation activities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Zoological Society of London. Domestic dogs are increasingly being recognized as a conservation threat for native species. In many places, their impacts may be as severe as other invasive predators such as cats and rats. We conducted the first ever sub-continent scale assessment of the impacts of dogs on native species in India using an online key informant survey and reports from national print media. Dogs reportedly attacked 80 species, of which 31 were IUCN Red list threatened species, including four Critically Endangered species. Larger bodied mammals such as ungulates and carnivores, were most commonly reported to be attacked, although this may be an observation bias. Approximately 68{\%} of the attacks were carried out by dogs unaccompanied by humans. Most of the attacks were carried out by packs of dogs with 45{\%} of these attacks leading to the death of the prey. Nearly 48{\%} of the incidents were reported in and around wildlife protected areas, suggesting that dogs are an important large-scale edge effect around protected areas in India. For Critically Endangered species that are already suffering from serious population declines due to other causes, the impact of dogs may seriously impede population recovery efforts. Mitigating the impacts of dogs on wildlife requires a multi-pronged approach of responsible dog ownership, restriction in free-ranging behaviour, and strong population control measures, especially around sensitive conservation areas.},

Using offspring phenotypes, we inferred who mated with whom and assigned offspring to parents. Like Bateman, we cultured adults expressing dramatic phenotypes, so that each adult was heterozygous-dominant at its unique marker locus but had only wild-type alleles at all other subjects' marker loci. Assuming no viability effects of parental markers on offspring, the frequencies of parental phenotypes in offspring follow mendelian expectations: one-quarter will be double-mutants who inherit the dominant gene from each parent, the offspring from which Bateman counted the number of mates per breeder; half of the offspring must be single mutants inheriting the dominant gene of one parent and the wild-type allele of the other parent; and one-quarter would inherit neither of their parent's marker mutations. Here we show that inviability of double-mutant offspring biased inferences of mate number and number of offspring on which rest inferences of sex differences in fitness variances. Bateman's method overestimated subjects with zero mates, underestimated subjects with one or more mates, and produced systematically biased estimates of offspring number by sex. Bateman's methodology mismeasured fitness variances that are the key variables of sexual selection.},

abstract = {Tri-axial accelerometer tags provide quantitative data on body movement that can be used to characterize behaviour and understand species ecology in ways that would otherwise be impossible. Using tags on wild terrestrial mammals, especially smaller species, in natural settings has been limited. Poor battery power also reduced the amount of data collected, which limits what can be derived about ani- mal behaviour. Another challenge using wild animals, is acquiring observations of actual behaviours with which to compare tag data and create an adequate training set to reliably identify behavioural states. Brown hares were fitted with accelerome- ters for 5 weeks to evaluate their use in collecting detailed behaviour data and activity levels. Collared hares were filmed to associate actual behaviours with tag data. Observed behaviours were classified using Random Forests (ensemble learn- ing method) to create a supervised model and then used to classify hare behaviour from the tags. Increased tag longevity allowed acquisition of large quantities of data from each individual and direct observation of tagged hare's behaviour. Ran- dom Forests accurately classified observed behaviours from tag data with an 11{\%} error rate. Individual accuracy of behaviours varied with running (100{\%} accuracy), feeding (94.7{\%}) and vigilance (98.3{\%}) having the highest classification accuracy. Hares spent 46{\%} of their time being vigilant and 25{\%} feeding when active. The combination of our tags and Random Forests facilitated large amounts of beha- vioural data to be collected on animals where observational studies could be lim- ited, or impossible. The same method could be used on a range of terrestrial mammals to create models to investigate behaviour from tag data, to learn more about their behaviour and be used to answer many ecological questions. However, further development of methods for analysing tag data is needed to make the process quicker, simpler and more accurate},

abstract = {Crocodilians and birds are the modern representatives of Phylum Archosauria. Although there have been recent advances in our understanding of the phylogeny and ecology of ancient archosaurs like dinosaurs, it still remains a challenge to obtain reliable information about their behaviour. The comparative study of birds and crocodiles represents one approach to this interesting problem. One of their shared behavioural features is the use of acoustic communication, especially in the context of parental care. Although considerable data are available for birds, information concerning crocodilians is limited. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about acoustic communication in crocodilians, from sound production to hearing processes, and to stimulate research in this field. Juvenile crocodilians utter a variety of communication sounds that can be classified into various functional categories: (1) "hatching calls", solicit the parents at hatching and fine-tune hatching synchrony among siblings; (2) "contact calls", thought to maintain cohesion among juveniles; (3) "distress calls", induce parental protection; and (4) "threat and disturbance calls", which perhaps function in defence. Adult calls can likewise be classified as follows: (1) "bellows", emitted by both sexes and believed to function during courtship and territorial defence; (2) "maternal growls", might maintain cohesion among offspring; and (3) "hisses", may function in defence. However, further experiments are needed to identify the role of each call more accurately as well as systematic studies concerning the acoustic structure of vocalizations. The mechanism of sound production and its control are also poorly understood. No specialized vocal apparatus has been described in detail and the motor neural circuitry remains to be elucidated. The hearing capabilities of crocodilians appear to be adapted to sound detection in both air and water. The ear functional anatomy and the auditory sensitivity of these reptiles are similar in many respects to those of birds. The crocodilian nervous system likewise shares many features with that of birds, especially regarding the neuroanatomy of the auditory pathways. However, the functional anatomy of the telencephalic auditory areas is less well understood in crocodilians compared to birds.},

abstract = {Integrating biomechanics, behavior and ecology requires a mechanistic understanding of the processes producing the movement of animals. This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 ground-truthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80-90{\%}) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750 km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities.},

abstract = {Nest predation is the main cause of hatch failure for many turtle populations. For loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at the Wreck Rock rookery, adjacent to Deepwater National Park in south-east Queensland, yellow-spotted goannas (Varanus panoptes) are the main nest predator. However, no studies have documented the space use of goannas in costal habitat adjacent to a sea turtle nesting beach. Here we used Global Positioning System data loggers to evaluate the spatial ecology of adult yellow-spotted goannas in order to discover their potential interaction with sea turtle nests. Male yellow-spotted goannas had larger home ranges, spent a greater proportion of their time in the beach dune area where sea turtles nest, and their home ranges overlapped with more sea turtle nests compared with females. Both males and females had a bimodal activity pattern, with peaks in activity in the early morning and mid to late afternoon. Examination of space-use patterns indicates that it is the larger male yellow-spotted goannas that are the main predators of sea turtle nests at the Wreck Rock beach-nesting aggregation. Hence, by inference, it is probable that large male yellow-spotted goannas are responsible for opening nests at other Australian mainland sea turtle beaches, and if a goanna-specific management strategy is implemented to control predation it is these large males that should be targeted.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}When animals or groups of animals in their wild habitats come close to each other within a defined distance, it is termed as an association. Observing two groups of the lion-tailed macaque at Nelliyampathy and Andiparai forests of the Western Ghats of India, we asked whether the lion-tailed macaque associations with the sympatric Nilgiri langur and bonnet macaque were by chance or had any biological significance. Employing ‘all occurrences' sampling, we recorded an association if a group of another primate species came within 30 m of the focal group of the lion-tailed macaque. Date, time, associating species, activity of the study species and of the associating species, type of interaction, aggressor and the recipient, species displaced and duration of the association were recorded. We used the Waser gas model to calculate the expected frequency and duration of associations and compared them with the observed associations. The lion-tailed macaque spent less time in associations than expected. The lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur initiated associations less often, and remained in association for less time, than expected by chance. Whereas the expected and observed initiation of associations between the lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur in Nelliyampathy was significantly different (expected rate = 153; observed rate = 64), in Andiparai, it was not (expected rate = 55.5; observed rate = 61). The expected and observed association duration was significantly different in Nelliyampathy (expected duration = 54 min; observed duration = 15 min) and Andiparai (expected duration = 48 min; observed duration = 19 min). In contrast, we detected few differences between observed and expected association frequency for the lion-tailed macaque and the bonnet macaque. Aggressive interactions were common in areas where density of the Nilgiri langur groups was high. This is the first study on Asian primates using the ideal gas approach to show that primates do not form active associations with each other.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Monitoring animal behaviour can prove challenging when working in inaccessible environments. This problem can be addressed by using animal attached accelerometers and automatic classifiers. This study considers the feasibility of using specially designed hardware to capture three-dimensional accelerometer data from sheep and to subsequently automatically classify their behaviour on the basis of these measurements. Five common be- haviours have been identified: Lying, standing, walking, running and grazing. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifiers were trained based on 10 features. A greedy selection procedure was used to determine which features provide the highest classification accuracy. It is shown that both classifiers can automatically identify the five behaviours with high accuracy when all the features are used for training. The LDA and QDA classifiers achieved an overall accu- racy of 87.1{\%} and 89.7{\%} respectively. Grazing was misclassified the most in both classifiers, because it was confused with lying. This result was expected considering the high similarity between the raw accelerometer data associated with grazing and lying. The QDA classifier showed larger improvements when using a smaller},

One rich and interesting source is the bio-logger. These small electronic wearable devices are attached to animals free to roam in their natural habitats, and report back readings from multiple sensors, including GPS and accelerometer bursts. A common use of accelerometer data is for supervised learning of behavioral modes. However, we need unsupervised analysis tools as well, in order to overcome the inherent difficulties of obtaining a labeled dataset, which in some cases is either infeasible or does not successfully encompass the full repertoire of behavioral modes of interest. Here we present a matrix factorization based topic-model method for accelerometer bursts, derived using a linear mixture property of patch features. Our method is validated via comparison to a labeled dataset, and is further compared to standard clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {Summary: Energetic balance is a central driver of individual survival and population change, yet estimating energetic costs in free- and wide-ranging animals presents a significant challenge. Animal-borne activity monitors (using accelerometer technology) present a promising method of meeting this challenge and open new avenues for exploring energetics in natural settings. To determine the behaviours and estimated energetic costs associated with a given activity level, three captive reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) at the Toronto Zoo were fitted with collars and observed for 53 h. Activity patterns were then measured over 13 months for 131 free-ranging woodland caribou (R. t. caribou) spanning 450 000 km2 in northern Ontario. The captive study revealed a positive but decelerating relationship between activity level and energetic costs inferred from previous behavioural studies. Field-based measures of activity were modelled against individual displacement, vegetation abundance (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), snow depth and temperature, and the best fit model included all parameters and explained over half of the variation in the data. Individual displacement was positively related to activity levels, suggesting that broad differences in energetic demands are influenced by variation in movement rates. After accounting for displacement, activity was highest at intermediate levels of vegetation abundance, presumably due to foraging behaviour. Snow depth, probably associated with digging for winter forage, moderately increased activity. Activity levels increased significantly at the coldest winter temperatures, suggesting the use of behavioural thermoregulation by caribou. These interpretations of proximate causal factors should be regarded as hypotheses subject to validation under normal field conditions. These results illustrate the landscape characteristics that increase energetic demands for caribou and confirm the great potential for the use of accelerometry in studies of animal energetics. {\textcopyright} 2014 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {1.Animal space use has been studied by focusing either on geographic (e.g., home ranges, species' distribution) or environmental (e.g., habitat use and selection) space. However, all patterns of space use emerge from individual movements, which are the primary means by which animals change their environment. 2.Individuals increase their use of a given area by adjusting two key movement components: the duration of their visit, and/or the frequency of re-visits. Thus, in spatially heterogeneous environments animals exploit known, high-quality resource areas by increasing their Residence Time (RT) in and/or decreasing their Time to Return (TtoR) to these areas. We expected that spatial variation in these two movement properties should lead to observed patterns of space use in both geographic and environmental spaces. We derived a set of 9 predictions linking spatial distribution of movement properties to emerging space use patterns. We predicted that, at a given scale, high variation in RT and TtoR among habitats leads to strong habitat selection, and that long RT and short TtoR result in a small home range size. 3.We tested these predictions using moose (Alces alces) GPS tracking data. We first modelled the relationship between landscape characteristics and movement properties. Then, we investigated how the spatial distribution of predicted movement properties (i.e., spatial autocorrelation, mean, and variance of RT and TtoR) influences home range size and hierarchical habitat selection. 4.In landscapes with high spatial autocorrelation of RT and TtoR, a high variation in both RT and TtoR occurred in home ranges. As expected, home range location was highly selective in such landscapes (i.e., 2(nd) -order habitat selection); RT was higher and TtoR lower within the selected home range than outside, and moose home ranges were small. Within home ranges, a higher variation in both RT and TtoR was associated to higher selectivity among habitat types (i.e., 3(rd) -order habitat selection). 5.Our findings show how patterns of geographic and environmental space use correspond to the two sides of a coin, linked by movement responses of individuals to environmental heterogeneity. By demonstrating the potential to assess the consequences of altering RT or TtoR (e.g., through human disturbance or climatic changes) on home range size and habitat selection, our work sets the basis for new theoretical and methodological advances in movement ecology.

abstract = {Anthropogenic subsidies are used by a variety of predators in areas developed for human use or residence. If subsidies promote population growth, these predators can have a negative effect on local prey species. The Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus) is an abundant predator in northern Alaska that is believed to benefit from garbage as a supplemental food source, but this supposition has never been tested. In summer 2008 and 2009, we recorded the Glaucous Gull's diet and reproduction at 10 breeding colonies in northern Alaska. Colonies were in industrial, residential, and undeveloped areas and ranged from 5 to 75 km from the nearest landfill. By colony, garbage occurred in zero to 85{\%} of pellets and food remains produced during the chick-rearing period, and the average number of chicks fledged per pair ranged from zero to 2.9. Random-forest analysis indicated that percent occurrence of garbage in the diet was the second most important factor (after number of eggs per pair) explaining variance in fledging rate. There was a significant positive correlation between percent occurrence of garbage in the diet and fledging rate in each year. If this correlation reflects a causal relationship, it suggests that human development that increases gulls' access to garbage could result in increased local gull populations. Such an increase could affect the gulls' natural prey species, including at least 14 species of shorebirds and waterfowl of conservation concern.},

abstract = {Previous studies have found that turtle nest depredation is concentrated immediately post-oviposition, likely because cues alerting predators to nest presence are most obvious during this time. In Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, we examined the frequency of nest depredation during the incubation period for Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina [Linnaeus, 1758]) and Midland Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta marginata [Agassiz, 1857]). Contrary to most past findings, nest depredation occurred throughout the incubation period for both species. In fact, 83{\%} and 86{\%} of depredation interactions with Snapping and Painted Turtle nests, respectively, occurred more than a week after oviposition at our study site. Peaks in nest depredation (weeks with ≥10{\%} nest depredation) occurred late in incubation and may have coincided with hatching. Trail cameras deployed at four nesting sites revealed six predator species interacting with nests. The presence of predators at nest sites increased late in the incubation period indicating a persistence or renewal (from hatching) of cues; additional research is necessary to determine the nature of these cues. These findings have implications for both research and turtle conservation. Further research should examine the relationship between temporal changes in predator species' density and patterns of nest depredation. Additionally, in areas where protective nest caging is used as a species recovery action, it may be important to ensure that cages remain in place throughout the incubation period until emergence of hatchlings.},

The study of wildlife activity patterns is an effective approach to understanding fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes. However, traditional statistical approaches used to conduct quantitative analysis have thus far had limited success in revealing underlying mechanisms driving activity patterns. Here, we combine wavelet analysis, a type of frequency-based time-series analysis, with high-resolution activity data from accelerometers embedded in GPS collars to explore the effects of internal states (e.g., pregnancy) and external factors (e.g., seasonal dynamics of resources and weather) on activity patterns of the endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Giant pandas exhibited higher frequency cycles during the winter when resources (e.g., water and forage) were relatively poor, as well as during spring, which includes the giant panda's mating season. During the summer and autumn when resources were abundant, pandas exhibited a regular activity pattern with activity peaks every 24 hr. A pregnant individual showed distinct differences in her activity pattern from other giant pandas for several months following parturition. These results indicate that animals adjust activity cycles to adapt to seasonal variation of the resources and unique physiological periods. Wavelet coherency analysis also verified the synchronization of giant panda activity level with air temperature and solar radiation at the 24-hr band. Our study also shows that wavelet analysis is an effective tool for analyzing high-resolution activity pattern data and its relationship to internal and external states, an approach that has the potential to inform wildlife conservation and management across species.},

An upper respiratory tract disease has been seen in populations of desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizi, in the Mojave Desert, USA, and certain populations of the gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus, in Florida, USA. Much more information is available on diseases of captive tortoises than on those of wild tortoises. Of infectious diseases, viral, bacterial, mycotic, and parasitic diseases have all been reported. Noninfectious diseases identified in tortoises include various nutritional diseases, hypothyroidism, and neoplasia. Virtually nothing is known about the effects of pollutants/ toxicants in individual or populations of tortoises.},

abstract = {Context Predation by feral cats is a key threatening process to many species of native Australian wildlife. Unfortunately, cats are difficult to capture using standard trapping techniques, limiting the potential to conduct research on their ecology and impacts. Aims We present an alternative capture method: remote chemical immobilisation after tracking with trained dogs. We also compare capture rates to a concurrent soft-jaw leg-hold trapping program. Methods We used dogs to capture cats detected by spotlighting at night, and also recaptured cats fitted with telemetry collars during the day. Cats were either bailed on the ground or treed and then hand-netted, or chemically immobilised using darts shot from a CO2-powered dart rifle, loaded with tiletamine-zolazepam at ∼6mgkg-1. Factors affecting the success rate of capturing cats using dogs were assessed. Efficiency in terms of cats captured per person-hours of fieldwork were compared using trained dogs versus leg-hold trapping. Key results We attempted 160 cat captures using the tracking dogs with 114 of those being successful. There were no mortalities or debilitating physical injuries associated with chemical immobilisation; however, sedated cats had prolonged recoveries ({\textgreater}4h). Capture success with the tracking dogs increased as the dogs gained experience. Capture success rates per person-hour of fieldwork were four times greater using spotlighting with tracking dogs than using leg-hold traps. The success rate of recaptures using dogs was 97{\%}. Conclusions The use of trained tracking dogs proved an effective method for capturing feral cats. The method had a much higher success rate than live-trapping with leg-hold traps, took less effort (in terms of person-hours) and caused less physical injuries than did leg-hold traps. However, substantial setup costs and time are required, which are discussed. Implications Using these methods could improve efficiency and outcomes when catching feral cats, and enable more data per individual cat to be collected than otherwise.},

abstract = {A study of 150 dog-owning households from six randomly selected sublocations was conducted in Machakos District, Kenya. Initially, all households were visited to collect information on dog ecology and demography based on WHO guidelines and to collect serum for rabies antibody detection. A second visit was made 1 year later, to obtain follow-up data on births, deaths, dog movements and other events since the first visit. Dog ownership was common, with a range of 53-81{\%} (mean = 63{\%}) of households owning dogs in the six sublocations. Dog density for the five more rural sublocations ranged from 6 to 21 dogs km-2 and for the peri-urban sublocation was 110 dogs km-2. The dog population was estimated to be growing at 9{\%} p.a. (95{\%} C.I. 4-14{\%}). This growth was a function of very high fecundity (1.3 females per female per year) more than compensating for high mortality, particularly among females. Life expectancy from birth was 3.5 years for males and 2.4 years for females. Half the dogs at any one time were less than 1 year of age. All dogs, by design of the study, were owned. Of these, 69{\%} were never restricted and roamed freely to forage for food and mix with other dogs. Only a small proportion of dogs (5{\%}) were fed commercial dog food. Most households reported observing dogs scavenging their garbage, including: their own dogs (81{\%}), their neighbours' dogs (75{\%}) and unknown dogs (45{\%}). Only 29{\%} of dogs at least 3 months of age were reported to be vaccinated against rabies. The proportion vaccinated varied widely between sublocations (5-68{\%}); 48{\%} of dogs reportedly vaccinated had detectable antibodies, 31{\%} at or above levels considered to indicate seroconversion. The proportion of dogs with detectable antibodies declined according to the time since last vaccination (55{\%} if vaccinated ≤ 1 year, 47{\%} ≤ 2 years and 36{\%} {\textgreater} 2 years); 20{\%} of dogs reported not to have been vaccinated had detectable rabies antibody. Compared to other dog populations in rural eastern and southern Africa, Machakos District has a high density of dogs. The Machakos dog population is growing, highly dynamic, poorly supervised and inadequately vaccinated against rabies. The main implication for rabies control is that adequate vaccination coverage is unlikely to be achieved, even under optimal delivery, using the current strategy of annual vaccination of dogs older than 3 months. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The Sunda colugo (Galeopterus variegatus), which is one of only two living species of dermopterans confined to Southeast Asia, reportedly occurs in tropical forests, plantations, and gardens. Based on their ecology, however, we predict that tropical forests are likely to be their primary habitats. Here, we investigate environmental variables that account for the occurrence of G. variegatus in Singapore using Bayesian inference. Our results show that G. variegatus was only detected in transects with over 95{\%} canopy cover, which was ultimately the most important predictor of colugo occurrence. Tropical forests, including disturbed forests, with relatively intact canopies are therefore vital for colugos to persist. ?? 2012 Deutsche Gesellschaft f??r S??ugetierkunde.},

In this article, we review many of the potential stressors that may adversely affect animals living in captivity. These include abiotic, environmental sources of stress such as artificial lighting, exposure to loud or aversive sound, arousing odors, and uncomfortable temperatures or substrates. In addition, confinement-specific stressors such as restricted movement, reduced retreat space, forced proximity to humans, reduced feeding opportunities, maintenance in abnormal social groups, and other restrictions of behavioral opportunity are considered. Research in support of the claims for these environmental elements as stressors for captive animals reveals no unique suite of behavioral or physiological responses that will clearly indicate the cause of those responses; rather, it is up to us as managers and caretakers of animals in captivity to evaluate enclosures and husbandry practices to ensure the optimal well-being of animals in our care. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Negative impacts of some introduced carnivores like feral cats are well documented, widespread, and significant. Comparatively, the effects of feral dogs (individuals that are not associated with people or human settlements) on native wildlife are poorly known, even though feral dogs occur worldwide. We assessed the density of feral dogs and compared relative abundance, activity patterns and habitat use of 10 species of mammals in areas with and without feral dogs in Cayambe-Coca National Park in the northern Ecuadorian Andes using line transect surveys, camera traps, and track and sign surveys. In areas where feral dogs were present, four native mammals were absent: mountain coati (Nasuella olivacea), mountain paca (Cuniculus taczanowskii), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), and northern pudu (Pudu mephistophiles). Relative abundances of six species were lower compared to areas without feral dogs: puma (Puma concolor), Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus), Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus), striped hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus), mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), and little red brocket deer (Mazama rufina). Three species significantly altered activity patterns where feral dogs were present (Andean bear, mountain tapir, and little red brocket deer). In contrast, none of the native mammal species exhibited shifts in habitat use in areas with feral dogs. Dogs used all habitat types according to availability. Our results point to feral dogs as a significant problem for the native mammal community of this Andean region, and highlight the need to consider feral dogs as a potential threat to wildlife in other regions where anthropogenic effects appear to be low but feral dogs are present, particularly natural areas that contain endangered and endemic species.},

Food availability for insectivorous birds foraging on the ground has been negatively affected, but the interactions between birds and their food availability are complex and often species-specific. Populations of Wrynecks Jynx torquilla are declining all over Europe, possibly because of reduced accessibility to their main prey, ground-dwelling ants, due to higher and denser ground vegetation. However, it is not clear which ground vegetation structures are tolerated by foraging Wrynecks and which habitats are preferred. Aims To identify the optimal ground vegetation structure and the main habitat types in which Wrynecks search for food. Method We radiotracked seven Wrynecks in high-intensity farmland in Switzerland to study foraging habitat use during the reproduction season. Several habitat variables were mapped at each foraging location and compared with locations selected randomly within individual home ranges. Results Wrynecks preferentially foraged at places with ≥50{\%} bare ground. Vegetation height was not important. Older fruit tree plantations and fallow land were the preferred foraging habitats. Conclusion Conservation measures should concentrate on preserving semi-open agricultural landscape matrices with loose ground vegetation cover to provide suitable foraging conditions. This can be achieved even in intensively managed farmland as illustrated in this study},

In Australia, the dingo (C. l. dingo) was introduced 4,000 years ago and, other than humans, is now the continent's top mammalian predator. Domestic dogs (C. l. familiaris) were introduced by Europeans more recently and they interbreed with dingoes. This hybridization has caused growing concern about the roles that domestic dogs and dingoes play in shaping ecosystem processes. There is also considerable debate about whether anthropogenic environmental changes can alter the ecological roles of dingoes. We used scat analysis to test whether the dingo, as the longer-established predator, occupies a different dietary niche from that of free-roaming domestic dogs, irrespective of human influence. Our results demonstrate considerable dietary overlap between dingoes and domestic dogs in areas where humans provide supplementary food, providing evidence against our hypothesi...},

abstract = {We compare differences in the reproductive strategies of "free-living" dogs with their wild relatives in the genus Canis, of which the dog is a very recently evolved member. The members of this genus display a greater range of parental motor patterns than generally seen in other species of Carnivora, including pair-bonding and extended parental care; parents regurgitate to offspring and provision them with food for months to as long as a year. But the domestic dog does not routinely display these genus-typical behaviors. While this has generally been assumed to be a result of direct human intervention, humans have little reproductive control over the vast majority of domestic dogs. We analyze the low frequency of display of genus-typical behaviors and postulate that the dog's reproductive behaviors are an adaptation to permanent human settlement and the waste resources associated with it. Adaptation to this environment has decreased seasonality, increased the fecundity of unrestrained dogs and reduced the need for prolonged parental care. The consequences of greater fecundity and reduced parental care are compared to the reproductive behavior of other species of the genus. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Determining where, when and how much animals eat is fundamental to understanding their ecology. We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either 'prey handling' or 'swimming'. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95±0.26{\%} (mean ± s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82±0.24{\%} when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09{\%}. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more 'wiggles' and 'dashes' (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean (±s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6±66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales.},

For felids, the main drivers of activity patterns appear to be prey availability and anthropogenic disturbances, as suggested by previous studies. In this study, we explore a set of variables that influence the activity patterns of Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) in Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces in north‐east China near south‐western Primorsky Krai, Russia. This area is currently the only occupied tiger habitat in China. Prey availability (e.g. wild boar, sika deer and roe deer), human disturbances (e.g. human activity, distance to human settlements and intense forest livestock grazing), and habitat structure were analysed. Our results revealed crepuscular and nocturnal activity of Amur tigers. Although the temporal overlaps between the tigers and their prey species were high, the spatial overlap indices were low. Although the presence of tigers decreased near human settlements, tigers showed a preference for walking along roads. Tigers also avoided high‐elevation coniferous and mixed hardwood forests. Overall, our results indicated that (1) tigers spatially and temporally avoided human disturbances and tigers respond behaviourally to human disturbances and (2) human disturbances may determine the activity of Amur tigers in north‐east China. In the future, to address conflicts between tigers and local humans and to improve tiger conservation, conservation planning should incorporate the spatio‐temporal activity patterns of tigers and humans.},

We collected over 1,968 hr of focal data on the adult male and 1,539 hr of focal data on the six females in a forest along the Menanggul River, Sabah, Malaysia. Availability and seasonal changes in plant species consumed by the focal monkeys were determined by vegetation surveys carried out across an area of 2.15 ha along 200-500 m trails in riverine forest. A total of 188 plant species were consumed by the focal monkeys. The activity budget of members of our study group was 76.5{\%} resting, 19.5{\%} feeding, and 3.5{\%} moving. Young leaves (65.9{\%}) and fruits (25.9{\%}) accounted for the majority of feeding time. Over 90{\%} of fruit feeding involved the consumption of unripe fruits and in the majority of case both the fruit flesh and seeds were eaten. Although fruit eating was rare in some months, during other times of the year time fruit feeding exceeded the time devoted to young leaves. We found that monthly fruit availability was positively related to monthly fruit eating and feeding activity, and seasonal fluctuations in dietary diversity were significantly affected by fruit eating. These results suggest that fruit availability and fruit-eating behaviors are key factors that influence the activity budget of proboscis monkeys. Earlier assumptions that colobine monkeys are obligate folivores do not apply well to proboscis monkeys and certain other colobines. Our findings may help contribute to a better understanding of the dietary adaptations and feeding ecology of Asian colobines.},

In Europe, and particularly Spain, foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are often captured using traditional methods such as nonlocking Spanish Snares (SS) set in an ad hoc fence line known as an alar, but these traditional European methods are rarely compared to modernly described restraints such as the Wisconsin Cable Restraint (WR). We evaluated rates of efficiency, selectivity, injury, and impacts to foxes and nontarget species when using SS (as traditionally set in an alar) or WR within alars or on trails in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. During 40,372 trap-nights from summer to winter of 2007, we captured 64 foxes, and 8 of 23 potential nontarget species. Our results indicated that WR set in trails were more efficient (0.28 capture rate) for capturing red foxes than SS set in an alar (0.11 capture rate). Relative to injury, foxes captured with the WR in the alar (95.4{\%}), and WR in trails (90.5{\%}), and the SS (90.9{\%}) showed no indicators of poor welfare, and injury score analysis indicated that injuries were of similar magnitude for all capture devices. Overall, the WR set in trails may have performed the best, but all 3 methods are likely sufficient for capturing foxes with minimal injury, acceptable efficiency, and acceptable impact to foxes and sympatric nontarget species. Thus, wildlife managers in Spain and elsewhere can apply our findings to optimize capture and management of foxes.},

abstract = {Recent studies have established the ecological and evolutionary importance of animal personali- ties. Individual differences in movement and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity, boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal syndromes. Yet, insights from the con- currently developing movement ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental hetero- geneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range uti- lization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population struc- ture with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex popu- lation-level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of con- sistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.},

abstract = {We report on the aquatic and terrestrial foraging behaviour and diet of the semi-aquatic Varanus mertensi. Foraging behaviour of V. mertensi is similar to that of other large terrestrial varanids: slow, methodical forwards movement with the head swaying from side to side with regular tongue flicks. Both olfactory and visual cues are used to detect prey. Foraging in the water is remarkably similar to that in the terrestrial environment, with this species using both visual and olfactory cues. Like other varanids, this species is able to use previous experiences to maximise its chance of locating prey. V. mertensi consume a large number of freshwater crabs (Holthuisana sp.) and a variety of small invertebrate and vertebrate prey across their distribution. Dietary differences across geographic regions are minor. Its diet is sufficiently catholic to enable it to adapt to seasonal and spatial differences in prey availability, one reason for its widespread distribution in the wet - dry tropics of Australia. Stomach contents differ from those of scats, with soft-bodied prey items being absent from scat samples},

abstract = {1. The energetic costs of different behaviours are critical in modulating the behavioural ecology of free-living animals. Despite this, measurement of energy expenditure in the field has proved difficult. 2. A new method with broad application for field studies has been proposed for determining the rate at which animals expend energy, based on measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) through the attachment of miniature acceleration data-loggers. This technique is easy to implement and has the promise to be able to resolve energy expenditure with fine (sub-second) temporal resolution, making it the only method which promises to able to determine the cost of short-lived behaviours. Increasing evidence supports the validity of the approach although the rationale behind it is vague. 3. This study explores link between metabolic energy and acceleration by examining what is known about how muscular tissue converts metabolic energy to mechanical work via muscular contraction and how Newtonian physics facilitates a derivation of Power (the rate at which work is performed) from acceleration. The link between metabolic energy and acceleration appears to involve three discrete processes: (i) the ratio of mechanical work to metabolic work performed by a single muscle (mechano-chemical efficiency); (ii) the ratio of external and internal work performed (mechanical work of the limbs in relation to that of the centre of mass); and (iii) the ratio of inertial to de novo mechanical work. These processes may vary according to the animal's mass, the medium in which it travels and its gait or behaviour. 4. Assessment of movement has limited application in defining non-movement energy expenditure such as that involved in specific dynamic action or non-shivering thermogenesis. However, this non-movement energy expenditure may often be modelled with reasonable confidence. The utility and appropriateness of the ODBA-energy expenditure method depends on a set of conditions, which we define and suggest should be assessed a priori. 5. This study explores the framework behind the ODBA-energy expenditure method to enable informed decisions to be made regarding the suitability for specific research questions addressed, as well as highlighting calibration needs.},

abstract = {Large predators have an indispensable role in structuring food webs and maintaining ecological processes for the benefit of biodiversity at lower trophic levels. Such roles are widely evident in marine and terrestrial systems [1, 2]. Large predators can indirectly alleviate predation on smaller (and often threatened) fauna and promote vegetation growth by interacting strongly with sympatric carnivore and herbivore species (e.g. [3-5]). The local extinction of large predators can therefore have detrimental effects on biodiversity [6], and their subsequent restoration has been observed to produce positive biodiversity outcomes in many cases [7]. Perhaps the most well-known example of this is the restoration of gray wolves Canis lupus to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of North America. Since the reintroduction of 66 wolves in 1995 [8], wolf numbers in the area have climbed to {\~{}}2000, some large herbivores and mesopredators have substantially declined, and some fauna and flora at lower trophic levels have increased (see [4], and references therein). Similar experiences with some other large predators mean that they are now considered to be of high conservation value in many parts of the world [1, 2, 7], and exploring their roles and functions has arguably been one of the most prominent fields of biodiversity conservation research in the last 10–15 years.},

Our results indicate that predation risk may have profound effects on the structure of ecosystems and is an important constituent of native biodiversity. Our conclusions are based on theory involving trophic cascades, predation risk, and optimal foraging; on the research literature; and on our own recent studies in Yellowstone National Park. Additional research is needed to understand how the lethal effects of predation interact with its nonlethal effects to structure ecosystems.},

abstract = {Vultures (Accipitridae and Cathartidae) are the only known obligate scavengers. They feed on rotting carcasses and are the most threatened avian functional group in the world. Possible effects of vulture declines include longer persistence of carcasses and increasing abundance of and contact between facultative scavengers at these carcasses. These changes could increase rates of transmission of infectious diseases, with carcasses serving as hubs of infection. To evaluate these possibilities, we conducted a series of observations and experimental tests of the effects of vulture extirpation on decomposition rates of livestock carcasses and mammalian scavengers in Kenya. We examined whether the absence of vultures changed carcass decomposition time, number of mammalian scavengers visiting carcasses, time spent by mammals at carcasses, and potential for disease transmission at carcasses (measured by changes in intraspecific contact rates). In the absence of vultures, mean carcass decomposition rates nearly tripled. Furthermore, the mean number of mammals at carcasses increased 3-fold (from 1.5 to 4.4 individuals/carcass), and the average time spent by mammals at carcasses increased almost 3-fold (from 55 min to 143 min). There was a nearly 3-fold increase in the mean number of contacts between mammalian scavengers at carcasses without vultures. These results highlight the role of vultures in carcass decomposition and level of contact among mammalian scavengers. In combination, our findings lead us to hypothesize that changes in vulture abundance may affect patterns of disease transmission among mammalian carnivores.},

abstract = {Dogs (Canis familiaris) are considered one of the most numerous carnivores worldwide. Although in the Global North dogs are popular companions, that live inside homes, about 80{\%} of the dogs in the world are village dogs. At present, village dogs in the Global South are a concern for (inter)national organizations and individuals, such as tourists. Concerns arise about: overpopulation, transmission of zoonoses, welfare of village dogs, and issues relating to dog-wildlife interactions, such as predation on wildlife. Dog culling has proved ineffective in managing dog populations, in controlling zoonoses, and preventing wildlife predation, but remains the dominant strategy to manage village dogs in Mexico. The objective of this thesis was to improve the understanding of human-dog interactions in coastal areas of Mexico in order to identify strategies - embedded in the social and cultural context - to manage village dogs. The Pacific Coast of Mexico was used as a case study area because of its high dog density and its importance for tourism and sea-turtle nesting. Village dogs interact with tourists and are known to scavenge sea-turtle nests. Conclusions presented are based on fieldwork conducted in three villages in Oaxaca and two in Michoac{\'{a}}n. This fieldwork comprised, among others, interviews with villagers, dog behavioral tests, and radio-tracking of village dogs. Village dogs that live nearby nature protected areas are part of three main systems: the household, the village, and the nature protected area. Humans keep dogs mainly for guarding, as work companions and as children's playmates. At household level, dogs interact with familiar (i.e. caregivers) and unfamiliar humans (e.g. visitors). At village level, dogs interact with familiar humans from other households, or with unfamiliar humans, such as tourists. At all system levels, village dogs have experiences with humans that may range from positive to negative, and this may be reflected in their behavioral responses towards humans. Dogs reported to engage in human-dog play (mainly with children) were more likely to respond with tail wagging to a caregiver's call and to approach an unfamiliar human. Dogs can enter a nature protected area (i.e. sea-turtle nesting beach) by themselves or with other dogs or humans. Food is a central element in the above-described holistic system. Village dogs scavenge for food in proximity to humans, beg for food, or prey on sea-turtle eggs. Body condition of village dogs was in general close to optimal, and dogs maintained body condition also in the low season for sea-turtle nesting and tourism. Nest scavenger dogs, however, had a lower metabolic energy intake of tortillas, and a larger mean distance from home compared to non-nest scavengers. This suggests that nest scavenging is hunger-driven, and therefore, solutions need to focus on caregivers' feeding practices. The keeping of dogs in the above-described system, is subject to clashing perceptions and discourses of external (e.g. tourists, authorities) and internal (villagers) stakeholders. External stakeholders refer to village dogs as stray or abandoned, and any dog that is not totally dependent on humans (e.g. village dog) is considered out of place. Total dependence of dogs on humans is a logical ethical argument deriving from the idea that humans took dogs out of the wild. Villagers' narratives, in contrast, perceive dogs as autonomous and able to take care of themselves (in line with the Village Dog theory of dog self-domestication). Dog welfare problems (i.e. dogs being too thin or sick) in coastal Oaxaca were perceived more by international than by Mexican tourists. Dog predation of sea-turtle nests was an important concern for tourists, but not for internal stakeholders.},

However, the potential implication of parental influence in density-related changes in life-history traits remains unclear in many insects that exhibit fluctuating population dynamics, particularly locusts. In this study, we report a laboratory experiment, which enabled us to characterize the life-history trait modifications induced by parental crowding of female individuals from a frequently outbreaking population of Locusta migratoria (Linnaeus) (Orthoptera: Acrididae). We found that a rearing history of crowding led to reduced female oviposition times and increased offspring size but did not affect the developmental time, survival, fecundity, and the sex-ratio and the number of offspring. Because all studied females were raised in a common environment (isolation conditions), these observed reproductive differences are due to trans-generational effects induced by density. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of the observed density-dependent parental effects on the life-history of L. migratoria.},

abstract = {Activity and movement patterns represent a fundamental aspect of a species natural history. Twenty fourhour movements of eastern coyotes or coywolves (Canis latrans x lycaon; hereafter eastern coyote for consistency purposes) ranged up to 31.9 linear km and averaged 23.5 + 7.3 (SD) km from 5-14 radio-fixes during each 24 hr monitoring period. Coyotes moved mostly at night and through altered open areas (e.g., powerlines, dumps) more than expected when compared to residential and natural areas. Coyotes inhabiting urbanized areas generally use residential areas for traveling and/or foraging. With large daily (or more aptly, nightly) movement patterns, resident coyotes can potentially be located anywhere within their large home ranges at any given time, as data revealed that one pack (3-4 individuals) can cover a combined 75-100 km per night, in a territory averaging 20-30 km2. Transient movements from capture location to end location varied from 23.0—100.5 km and averaged 63.8 km for two females and 49.3 km for four males. Eastern coyotes travel long distances even in human-dominated areas, allowing transients to find vacant territories. Because of their ability to move through urban areas and to colonize and recolonize areas, management efforts should focus more on educating the public about actual coyote behavior and their life history needs than on killing them.},

We tested the Belisle{\textregistered}, Panda{\textregistered}, and the Wildlife Service systems to capture coyotes in south Texas during February 1998 and February 1999. We designed field work to determine capture efficiency and selectivity and performed whole-body necropsies to identify trap-related injuries. Results showed a final capture rate (coyote capture per capture opportunity) of 78{\%} for the Belisle, 8.3{\%} for the Panda, 41{\%} for the Collarum, and 66{\%} for the Wildlife Services system. Some of these prototype systems may cause fewer injuries than traditional capture methods but may not be as efficient as jawed traps. To meet or exceed guidelines of recently established international standards for humane trapping, 80{\%} of captured animals cannot show injury indicators of poor welfare, but the Belisle, Wildlife Services, and Collarum devices did not cross this threshold (31{\%}, 40{\%}, 70{\%}, respectively, did not show any indicators). We were not able to capture enough animals with the Panda to thoroughly evaluate the device for selectivity and injury. However, simple modifications and improvements are ongoing and are likely to result in versions of these devices with improved efficiency and fewer indicators of injury},

abstract = {An understanding of how top mammalian carnivores respond to urbanization is important for conservation and management of human–wildlife conflicts. Coyotes (Canis latrans) have recently become more prevalent in many metropolitan areas; however, their apparent success is poorly understood. We estimated home-range size and selection of land-use types for coyotes in a heavily urbanized landscape, with a particular focus on responses of coyotes to those parts of the urban landscape with high levels of human development or activity. Mean (6 SE) annual home ranges of transient coyotes (X¯ 5 26.80 6 2.95 km2) were larger than those of resident coyotes (X¯ 5 4.95 6 0.34 km2), and home-range size for resident coyotes did not vary among seasons or between age and sex classes. Although most home ranges were associated with natural patches of habitat, there was considerable variation among coyotes, with some home ranges entirely lacking patches of natural habitat. Within home ranges, coyotes typically avoided land-use types associated with human activity (i.e., Residential, Urban Grass, and Urban Land) regardless of coyote characteristics, seasons, and activity periods. Few coyotes were nuisances, and conflicts occurred when coyotes were sick or exposed to wildlife feeding by humans. We found little evidence that coyotes were attracted to areas associated with human activity, despite at times having home ranges located in heavily developed areas.},

abstract = {Previous work has shown that under elevated predation risk, male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) switch from courtship to less conspicuous coercive mating at- tempts. This behavioural transition is traditionally inter- preted as a ‘risk-sensitive' response that makes males less conspicuous to predators. However, predation risk leads to behavioural changes (such as schooling and predator inspection) in females that may result in coer- cive mating attempts being more profitable in high-risk situations. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the switch to coercive mating by male guppies in high-risk situa- tions is mediated by adjustments in female behaviour, rather than directly by the predator. We used replicate models resembling a known guppy predator to simulate predation risk in wild-caught guppies from a high-preda- tion population in Trinidad. Our results revealed that males performed proportionately more coercive mating attempts when presented with a female that had been ex- posed previously to a model predator compared to when males were paired with non-exposed females. Total mating activity (combined rates of courtship and forced mating attempts) did not differ significantly among the two treatment groups, indicating that overall mating activity is unaffected by predation risk. Importantly, when we subsequently presented both sexes concurrently with a predator model, total mating activity and the pro- portion of forced mating attempts remained unchanged in the high-risk treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that the transition from courtship to forced mating attempts under elevated predation risk is mediated by changes in female behaviour, which we suggest may favour the use of coercive mating under high predation risk.},

abstract = {In the eastern white river crayfish, Procambarus acutus acutus, the processes that act during hierarchy formation were explored by analyzing the behavior of 23 symmetric pairs of form I males. The experimental design comprised three subsequent phases: isolation, familiarization, and experimental phases. In the latter, pairs were formed of (i) unfamiliar opponents having different status, (ii, iii) unfamiliar opponents having the same status, either two alphas or two betas, and (iv) familiar opponents. The first result was that P. a. acutus is capable of establishing stable dominance hierarchies. Secondly, behavioral differences between the winners and the losers, a fast assessment of status, and self-reinforcing effects of recent experience were demonstrated. Thirdly, P. a. acutus was found to recognize the status of its rival but not its individual identity. In fact, even if paired with unfamiliar opponents, previous winners and losers behaved as in the preceding days. Conversely, both frequency and intensity of fighting increased when individuals of the same rank were opposed. These phenomena might be a consequence of “winning and losing effects”. However, the increased readiness of former betas to attack contradicts the loser effect and validates the hypothesis of status recognition.},

abstract = {The crested porcupine Hystrix cristata is a large rodent which pairs for life. We studied the space use of 17 female and 9 male radio-tracked porcupines in an evergreen coastal woodland ("macchia", EW) and in an agricultural estate (AE), with special reference to the use of cultivations. Home range sizes of male porcupines (4.72-323.40) ranged around 114. ha (median) during the warm period (April-September) and 162. ha during the cold one (October-March). Home ranges of females (2.48-323.40) were c. 91. ha during the warm period and c. 143. ha during the cold one. Habitat composition and selection changed from the cold to the warm months, with porcupines being present in agricultural areas especially in the latter. Home range overlap between members of the same pair varied from 57{\%} to 97{\%} (median, 75{\%}). Habitat selection was analyzed at the second (within study area) and at the third (within home range) order of selection. Within study areas, porcupines avoided cultivations and selected habitats with dense vegetation, providing cover and food. Within home ranges, in the warm period, porcupines selected agricultural areas in EW, where this habitat represented a minor portion of the study site. In that season, the Mediterranean "macchia" is a poor source of food, forcing porcupines to travel long distances to reach feeding sites. No significant difference of habitat selection within home ranges was detected between members of the same pair. Cultivations may play a key-role for porcupine survival, especially in poor habitats, as they provide abundant food resources in the warm period.},

abstract = {This study presents findings on seasonal and diur- nal behavioural patterns of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis)off the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. Data on the activity state of focal groups were collected by instan- taneous scan-sampling at 3 min intervals from a 5.5 m rigid-hull inflatable boat. Predominant group activity was classified as one of 5 categories. The overall proportion of time spent in these activities was 54.8{\%} traveling, 20.5{\%} milling, 17{\%} feeding. 7.3{\%} socializing, and 0.4{\%} resting. Comparisons with activity budgets of bottlenose dolphins indi- cated a roughly similar pattern. Time-of-day and time of low tide appeared to influence diurnal common dolphin behaviour. Seasonal fluctuations in activity budget did not show a consistent trend. The role of sea surface temperature and prey avail- ability in affecting common dolphin movements is discussed. Mean group size peaked in late summer at 140 individuals. Overall, the average number of individuals in a group was 55.1. Group composition appeared to be rather fluid, because fission and fusion of groups were observed frequently. Low photo-identification resighting rates suggested a large, possibly transient population. The present activity budget provides valuable information on the behaviour of free-ranging common dolphins, which could be useful in the conservation and management of this species.},

abstract = {Amphibians are currently suffering a period of mass extinction with approximately 20{\%} of species under severe threat and more than 120 species already extinct. In light of this crisis there is an urgency to establish viable ex situ populations and also find the causes of in situ declines. The role of ultraviolet radiation and Vitamin D3 in amphibian health directly influences both ex situ and in situ populations. Vitamin D3 can be photosynthesised endogenously via UV-B radiation (UV-B), or acquired through the diet, and then metabolised to calcitriol the biologically active hormonal form. Although, there is a lack of literature concerning Vitamin D3 requirements and calcitriol synthesis in amphibians, amphibians are likely to have similar Vitamin D3 requirements and metabolic processes as other vertebrates due to the phylogenetically conservative nature of calcitriol biosynthesis. Deficiencies in calcitriol in amphibians result in nutritional metabolic bone disease (NMBD) and could compromise reproduction and immunity. However, excess biologically active UV radiation has also proven detrimental across all three amphibian life stages and therefore could impact both in situ and ex situ populations. Here we review the role and necessity of UV-B and calcitriol in amphibians and the potential for negative impacts due to excessive exposure to UV radiation. We also identify priorities for research that could provide critical information for maintaining healthy in ex situ and in situ populations of amphibians. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigated predation of simulated turtle nests in an effort to understand how land-use patterns and the availability of nesting habitat may affect turtle recruitment in a region where human populations and associated development are increasing. Simulated nests were patterned after those created by painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), a common aquatic turtle in our study area, and distributed in four patterns (clustered and near pond, scattered and near pond, clustered and far from pond, and scattered and far from pond) around 36 ponds. Landscape composition (500-2000 m from pond perimeters) and habitats surrounding pond edges (an area extending 250 m from the shore of each pond) were then compared with rates of predation at each pond. Nest-site characteristics also were compared to the fate of individual nests. Landscape composition and habitats surrounding ponds apparently had little influence on predation rates. Nest distribution and the immediate habitat features associated with each nest did affect vulnerability to predation. Clumped nests were preyed upon at a higher rate than scattered nests, and nests close to ponds (within 50 m) were more vulnerable to predators than those created far (100-150 m) from a pond. Counter to our expectations, proximity to edge habitats (other than the shore of a pond) reduced the probability that a nest would be detected by predators. Also, nests placed near roads and suburban lawns had a reduced likelihood of predation whereas those placed in agricultural areas or disturbed sites had a greater probability of being preyed upon. Our results suggest that predation of simulated turtle nests may be a consequence of their distribution and location relative to the foraging activities of common nest predators, especially raccoons (Procyon lotor). Efforts to enhance recruitment among declining populations of turtles should consider the abundance and distribution of nesting habitat. Providing additional nesting sites away from predator foraging habitats may reduce nest predation and increase the recruitment of hatchlings into a population. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hunting by humans constitutes a major source of mortality that selects for avoidance strategies. Group formation in eiders Somateria mollissima in response to hunting from motorboats was studied in the Danish Wadden Sea as an avoid- ance strategy to humans. In autumn the birds' food demand and energy consumption are relatively low and the need for optimal feeding opportunities are not as essential as during winter. We tested the hypothesis that eiders aggregate in groups of variable size dependent on predation risk (hunting), season and site. During autumn at the preferred feeding sites eiders occur in small numbers and group size increase together with hunting activity. Opposite during winter, eiders occur in large numbers and group size decrease when hunting activity increase. Hunting activity displaced eiders to adjacent sites with no or low hunting intensity and low food availability where group size of eiders increase during both autumn and winter in relation to the overall hunting activity. The formation into larger groups when hunting activity increase is probably due to increasing effects of vigilance and dilution, whereas formation into smaller groups is assumed to reduce the eiders con- spicuousness to hunters. This change in group size made it possible for eiders to forage in areas with high food availability and high hunting intensity, while minimizing the risk of being detected by hunters. When the largest numbers of hunters were present at the preferred feeding site, group sizes during both autumn and winter were 110–125 eiders, indicating an optimal group size in relation to hunting density. Eiders located outside preferred feeding sites were in poorer body condition, suggesting that displacement was a suboptimal decision caused by hunting. We conclude that eiders adopted regrouping and displacement as two different strategies during hunting. Both strategies are tradeoffs between the risks of being detected by hunters and killed, and the benefits of feeding on mussel stocks thereby increasing body condition and hence fitnes},

We made three types of approach to nests (walking, running or leading a dog). We measured the flush distance, length of time parents spent off the nest and distraction display intensity. Leading a dog caused the greatest disruption of incubation, while responses to walking and running approaches did not differ significantly. Distraction display intensity appeared to be unrelated to approach type. There was evidence of habituation to humans on busy beaches. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that shorebirds perceive dogs as posing more of a threat than humans on foot, and that their subsequent avoidance response is greater. We recommend that human activity, particularly the walking of dogs, should be limited near nesting sites. Further study on causes of nest failure is required. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Research on wild animal ecology is increasingly employing GPS telemetry in order to determine animal movement. However, GPS systems record position intermittently, providing no information on latent position or track tortuosity. High frequency GPS have high power requirements, which necessitates large batteries (often effectively precluding their use on small animals) or reduced deployment duration. Dead-reckoning is an alternative approach which has the potential to ‘fill in the gaps' between less resolute forms of telemetry without incurring the power costs. However, although this method has been used in aquatic environments, no explicit demonstration of terrestrial dead-reckoning has been presented. Results: We perform a simple validation experiment to assess the rate of error accumulation in terrestrial dead- reckoning. In addition, examples of successful implementation of dead-reckoning are given using data from the domestic dog Canus lupus, horse Equus ferus, cow Bos taurus and wild badger Meles meles. Conclusions: This study documents how terrestrial dead-reckoning can be undertaken, describing derivation of heading from tri-axial accelerometer and tri-axial magnetometer data, correction for hard and soft iron distortions on the magnetometer output, and presenting a novel correction procedure to marry dead-reckoned paths to ground-truthed positions. This study is the first explicit demonstration of terrestrial dead-reckoning, which provides a workable method of deriving the paths of animals on a step-by-step scale. The wider implications of this method for the understanding of animal movement ecology are discussed.},

abstract = {Humans alter landscapes and native species distributions in many ways, including alterations mediated via domestic pets. While the negative impacts of domestic cats are well documented worldwide, the ecological effects of domestic dogs have received less scientific attention, particularly in the United States. Prevalence of free-ranging dogs may be especially problematic in areas with low density, but relatively ubiquitous human populations. We used camera-trap data collected during a 2008–2010 landscape-scale study consisting of 1181 camera stations (357 camera clusters) stratified over 16 counties in southern Illinois, USA, to estimate occupancy for domestic cats and dogs. We compared models of occupancy for three land cover types (forest, grassland, and wetland) in relation to anthropogenic features and estimated and compared the proportion of the region occupied by each species. Cats occurred across a moderate proportion of the landscape ($\psi$¯ = 0.44 ± 0.13 SE) and were associated with anthropogenic features. Moreover, we found domestic dog occupancy was greater across the landscape ($\psi$¯ = 0.59 ± 0.09), influenced more generally by land cover type, and was highest on grasslands and privately owned land. Domestic cat occupancy was more localized than that of dogs and less influenced by land cover type compared to anthropogenic features. Model averaged probability of dog occupancy was {\textgreater}0.50 across 19,049.39 km2of the region ({\textgreater}99{\%}), but only 2270.53 km2(11.8{\%}) for cats. Thus, while domestic cats may pose a more intensive threat to wildlife within the area they occupy, the impact of domestic dogs is likely to be more geographically extensive. Predicting the potential effects of these non-native species is complicated by a nuanced interaction between landscape composition, human density, and human behavior, and upends simplistic perceptions of the relative threats posed by the two species.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (285–320nm) is considered important for metabolic processes and reproduction in many reptile species by facilitating the synthesis of vitamin D3. In captivity, UVB radiation reaching an animal may be diminished by the properties of the materials used in enclosure construction. We investigated the UVB-attenuating properties of 14 materials commonly used in cage tops for reptile enclosures. Irradiances were measured by two types of hand-held broadband radiometers and the D3-synthesizing potential was assessed by the use of an in vitro model. For UV-transmitting acrylic, a significant discrepancy between meter irradiances and in vitro model values for D3-synthesizing ability was observed, with meter readings underestimating the blocking effect. In contrast, attenuation of UVB irradiances by air-permeable materials, such as wire screen, measured with meters was generally comparable to the attenuation of D3-synthesizing ability as measured by in vitro models. Relatively simple meter readings can therefore be used to reflect reduction of D3-synthesizing ability through air-permeable materials.},

abstract = {1. Energetics of reproduction in birds is reviewed with the question in mind how the parent adjusts its effort in relation to prevailing environmental conditions in order to maximize the output of young in its lifetime. Emphasis is on proximate controls, rather than ultimate factors measurable in terms of adult survival and recruitment of young. 2. The decision to breed or not to breed is clearly related to body condition of the female, presumably because of the implications this has for survival. 3. Laying date and clutch size are likewise under the influence of female condition and can hence be modified by experiments involving supplementary feeding. Natural variation in these features may often be related to territory quality. 4. How the bird decides whether or not to commence a second brood is not clear, but in the Great Tit the habitat-related difference in incidence of second broods is functionally understandable when survival probabilities of birds at different times are considered. 5. A distinction is made between a "capital" and "income" model for translatting rates of change of female body condition into appropriate decisions on laying date and clutch size and experiments are suggested that discriminate between the two. 6. Lack's view that brood size is in an evolutionary sense adjusted in order to balance food requirement and foraging capacity of the parents is accepted, and growth rates in nidicolous birds are analysed to ascertain if a finer adjustment exists superimposed on the integer steps of brood adjustment. Critical for this analysis are groups of birds where broods of one are common, since only in these circumstances is growth adjustment the only strategy open to the parents. In common with other animals, growth rate is related to mature body size but within a category of adult weight clear examples can be found for retardation of growth rate in pelecaniform and charadriiform species with singleton broods. 7. Since daily energy requirement is related to nestling size and growth rate, retardation of growth is explicable as a strategy only in terms of reducing the daily commitment of the parents, not reducing the total cost of producing a nestling. 8. An additional economy in growth is to reduce the contribution of fat to the nestling body. 9. Implied in Lack's view of brood size is a limitation of parental foraging capacity, and the last section of the paper is devoted to exploration of the proximate factors delimiting what Royama terms the optimal working capacity of parents feeding young. Observations of parent starlings confronted with manipulated brood size suggest a limit on the time that can be devoted to energetically extravagant flight activity, rather than a shortage of absolute time. Beyond the limit to which stressed parents can be made to fly, body weight declines. 10. Preliminary data on energy metabolized daily by parents confronted with large broods conforms to the simplified view that parental effort on a sustained basis equates to energy mobilization equivalent to 4 B.M.R. units and it is suggested that this level of energy expenditure represents a proximal decision substrate for determining the optimal working capacity of the parent. 11. The paper ends with a plea for more research on the proximate controls of avian reproduction, and calls attention to the central importance of the protein bank to parental body condition.},

While offspring signalling has been well-studied in birds, the modulation of parental care in crocodilians remains an open question. Here we show that acoustic communication has a key role in the dynamics of crocodilian' mother-offspring relationships. We found embedded information about the emitter's size in juvenile calls of several species, and experimentally demonstrated that Nile crocodile mothers breeding in the wild are less receptive to the calls of larger juveniles. Using synthetized sounds, we further showed that female' reaction depends on call pitch, an important cue bearing size information. Changes in acoustic interactions may thus go with the break of maternal care as well as dispersal of juvenile crocodilians. This process could have characterized other archosaurs displaying rapid early growth such as dinosaurs and pterosaurs.},

The results document a distinctively faster growth in the captive animals. Indications for the same phenomenon in other tortoise species (Galapagos giant tortoises, G. nigra; Spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca; Desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizi) were found in the literature. The cause of the high growth rate most likely is the constant provision with highly digestible food of low fiber content. Increased growth rates are suspected to have negative consequences such as obesity, high mortality, gastrointestinal illnesses, renal diseases, "pyramiding," fibrous osteodystrophy or metabolic bone disease. The apparently widespread occurrence of high growth rates in intensively managed tortoises underlines how easily ectothermic animals can be oversupplemented with nutrients.},

abstract = {An ethogram is a catalogue of discrete behaviors typically employed by a species. Traditionally animal behavior has been recorded by observing study individuals directly. However, this approach is difficult, often impossible, in the case of behaviors which occur in remote areas and/or at great depth or altitude. The recent development of increasingly sophisticated, animal-borne data loggers, has started to overcome this problem. Accelerometers are particularly useful in this respect because they can record the dynamic motion of a body in e.g. flight, walking, or swimming. However, classifying behavior using body acceleration characteristics typically requires prior knowledge of the behavior of free-ranging animals. Here, we demonstrate an automated procedure to categorize behavior from body acceleration, together with the release of a user-friendly computer application, "Ethographer". We evaluated its performance using longitudinal acceleration data collected from a foot-propelled diving seabird, the European shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis. The time series data were converted into a spectrum by continuous wavelet transformation. Then, each second of the spectrum was categorized into one of 20 behavior groups by unsupervised cluster analysis, using k-means methods. The typical behaviors extracted were characterized by the periodicities of body acceleration. Each categorized behavior was assumed to correspond to when the bird was on land, in flight, on the sea surface, diving and so on. The behaviors classified by the procedures accorded well with those independently defined from depth profiles. Because our approach is performed by unsupervised computation of the data, it has the potential to detect previously unknown types of behavior and unknown sequences of some behaviors.},

Despite daily checks of snares, there was a very high mortality ({\textgreater}80{\%}) of target and non-target species. Moreover, a large proportion of the animals were caught by the neck.

abstract = {Herbivores must balance energy needs with avoiding risks, using various cues to assess predation risk. The American beaver (Castor canadensis) is a semi-aquatic herbivore vulnerable to predation on land by wolves (Canis lupis). We tested the use of wolf urine as a potential tool to reduce human-beaver conflicts. We used infrared cameras to monitor use of terrestrial foraging trails by beavers during food cache construction in Seney National Wildlife Refuge, Michigan, from September to November 2008. Two foraging trails at 15 colonies (30 total trails) were monitored for 1 week to establish baseline use. One trail from each colony was then treated with wolf urine, and all trails were monitored an additional week to estimate changes in trail use. Mean number of beavers detected decreased 95{\%} on urinetreated trails and was unchanged on untreated trails. Beavers also spent 95{\%} less time on urine-treated trails as estimated by photograph time stamps, but did not change time spent on untreated trails. Sixteen other taxa of wildlife were detected; however, avoidance of urine-treated trails was not observed in these taxa. Species richness increased with urine treatment, mostly due to increased visitation by carnivores. Beavers appear to use olfaction to assess predation risk on land. Wolf urine may be a suitable deterrent for beaver herbivory.},

Some insect species can be grown on organic side streams, reducing environmental contamination and transforming waste into high-protein feed that can replace increasingly more expensive compound feed ingredients, such as fish meal. This requires the development of cost-effective, automated mass-rearing facilities that provide a reliable, stable, and safe product. In the tropics, sustainable harvesting needs to be assured and rearing practices promoted, and in general, the food resource needs to be revalorized.

abstract = {Carnivores are difficult to survey due, in large part; to their relative rarity across the landscape and wariness toward humans. Several noninvasive methods may aid in overcoming these difficulties, but there has been little discussion of the relative merits and biases of these techniques. We assess the value of 5 noninvasive techniques based on results from 2 multiyear studies of carnivores (including members of Camivora and Didelphidae) in New York forests. Two metrics were particularly valuable in assessing the species-specific value of any particular survey technique: latency to initial detection (LTD) and probability of detection (POD). We found differences in the value of techniques in detecting different species. For midsized species (raccoon [Procyon lotor], fisher [Martes pennanti], opossum [Didelphis virginiana], and domestic cat [Felis catus]), camera traps and track-plates were approximately equivalent in detection efficiency, but the potential for wariness toward the survey apparatus resulted in higher LTD for track-plates than for cameras. On the other hand, track-plates detected small carnivores (marten [M. americana] and weasels [Mustela spp.]) more often than cameras and had higher PODs for small and midsized species than did cameras. Cameras were efficient mechanisms for surveying bears (Ursus americanus; low LTD, high POD) but functioned poorly for discerning presence of coyotes (Canis latrans; high LTD, low POD). Scat surveys and snowtracking were the best methods for coyotes, which avoided camera traps and artificial tracking surfaces. Our analysis of fecal DNA revealed that trail-based fecal surveys were inefficient at detecting species other than coyotes, with the possible exception of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Genetic analyses of feces and snowtracking revealed the presence of foxes at sites where other techniques failed to discern these species, suggesting that cameras and track-plates are inefficient for surveying small canids in this region. The LTD of coyotes by camera traps was not correlated with their abundance as indexed by scat counts, but for other species this metric may offer an opportunity to assess relative abundance across sites. Snowtracking surveys were particularly robust (high POD) for detecting species active in winter and may be more effective than both cameras and track-plates where conditions are suitable. We recommend that survey efforts targeting multiple members of the carnivore community use multiple independent techniques and incorporate mechanisms to truth their relative value.},

abstract = {1. The selection ratio (SR), i.e. the ratio of proportional use of a habitat over proportional availability of this habitat, has for long been the standard metric of habitat selection analyses. It is easy to compute and directly estimates disproportionate use. Its apparent restriction to habitat selection analyses using categorical predictors led to the development of the resource selection functions (RSF) approach, which has now become the norm. 2. The RSF approach has however led to debates and confusion. For instance, what functional form can be used remains debated, and the concept of relative probability of selection is often misunderstood. 3. I propose a reformulation of the SR demonstrating that it can be estimated in a regression context, and thus even with continuous predictors. This reformulation suggests that RSF can be seen as an intermediate step in the calculation of SR. This reformulation also clarifies some long-standing debates about RSF and data-selection/fitting practices. 4. I further suggest that SR estimates the strength of habitat selection, but that the contribution of selection in determining use, which should be more directly linked to fitness than selection per se, should be estimated by another metric, the selection effect on use (SE). SE could be estimated simply as the difference between proportional use and proportional availability, and can be computed from SR and a density estimation of availability. 5. I conduct a habitat selection analysis of plains zebras to demonstrate the added-value of going beyond RSF scores and using SR estimated in a regression context, and of combining SR and SE. 6. Overall, I highlight the inter-relation between various metrics used to study habitat selection (i.e., SR, other selection indices, RSF scores, marginality). I conclude by proposing that SR and SE can be the unifying metrics of habitat selection, as together they offer a comprehensive view on the strength of habitat selection and its effect on habitat use.},

abstract = {Densely vegetated environments have hindered collection of basic population parameters on forest-dwelling ungulates. Our objective was to develop a mark-recapture technique that used DNA from fecal pellets to overcome constraints associated with estimating abundance of ungulates in landscapes where direct observation is difficult. We tested our technique on Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoilells hemio1111S sitkensis) in the temperate coastal rainforest of Southeast Alaska. During 2006-2008, we sampled fecal pellets of deer along trail transects in 3 intensively logged watersheds on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. We extracted DNA from the surface of fecal pellets and used micro satellite markers to identifY individual deer. With genotypes of individual deer, we estimated abundance of deer with moderate precision (±20{\%}) using mark-recapture models. Combining all study sites, we identified a 30{\%} (SE = 5.1{\%}) decline in abundance during our 3-year study, which we attributed to 3 consecutive severe winters. We determined that deer densities in managed land logged {\textgreater}30 years ago (7 deer/km2, SE = 1.3) supported fewer deer compared to both managed land logged {\textless}30 years ago (10 deer/km2, SE = 1.5) and unmanaged land (12 deer/km2, SE = 1.4). Our study provides the first estimates of abundance (based on individually identified deer) for Sitka black-tailed deer and the first estimates of abundance of an unenclosed ungulate population using DNA from fecal pellets. Our tool enables managers to accurately and precisely estimate the abundance of deer in densely vegetated habitats using a non-invasive approach.},

abstract = {An intriguing feature of most hymenopteran venoms is that they display broad antimicrobial activity. In particular, the venoms of social Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees) represent the most conspicuous source of antimicrobial secretions. In solitary and parasitic species, venom is used to immobilize or kill prey and to preserve them as stored food for their immature brood. In social species, venom is frequently also externalized both onto the cuticle and the nest surface. This indicates that venom use in Hymenoptera is not just restricted to hunting activities or to deter predators, but is also actively used as an externalized defensive agent, providing a first chemical barrier against microorganisms present in the environment. This chapter will discuss the importance and biological significance of venom as part of an external immune defense in Hymenoptera with special emphasis on social species. In addition ecological and environmental factors constraining the use of venom as external immune defense will be highlighted.},

abstract = {Accurately estimating home range and understanding movement behavior can provide important information on ecological processes. Advances in data collection and analysis have improved our ability to estimate home range and movement parameters, both of which have the potential to impact species conservation. Fitting continuous-time movement model to data and incorporating the autocorrelated kernel density estimator (AKDE), we investi- gated range residency of forty-four jaguars fit with GPS collars across five biomes in Brazil and Argentina. Weassessed home range and movement parameters of range resident ani- mals and compared AKDE estimates with kernel density estimates (KDE).Weaccounted for differential space use and movement among individuals, sex, region, and habitat quality. Thirty-three (80{\%}) of collared jaguars were range resident. Home range estimates using AKDE were 1.02 to 4.80 times larger than KDE estimates that did not consider autocorrela- tion. Males exhibited larger home ranges, more directional movement paths, and a trend towards larger distances traveled per day. Jaguars with the largest home ranges occupied the Atlantic Forest, a biome with high levels of deforestation and high human population density. Our results fill a gap in the knowledge of the species' ecology with an aim towardsbetter conservation of this endangered/critically endangered carnivore—the top predator in the Neotropics.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {1. Time and energy are key currencies in animal ecology, and judicious management of these is a primary focus for natural selection. At present, however, there are only two main methods for estimation of rate of energy expenditure in the field, heart rate and doubly labelled water, both of which have been used with success; but both also have their limitations. 2. The deployment of data loggers that measure acceleration is emerging as a powerful tool for quantifying the behaviour of free-living animals. Given that animal movement requires the use of energy, the accelerometry technique potentially has application in the quantification of rate of energy expenditure during activity. 3. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that acceleration can serve as a proxy for rate of energy expenditure in free-living animals. We measured rate of energy expenditure as rates of O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) in great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) at rest and during pedestrian exercise. VO2 and VCO2 were then related to overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) measured with an externally attached three-axis accelerometer. 4. Both VO2 and VCO2 were significantly positively associated with ODBA in great cormorants. This suggests that accelerometric measurements of ODBA can be used to estimate VO2 and VCO2 and, with some additional assumptions regarding metabolic substrate use and the energy equivalence of O2 and CO2, that ODBA can be used to estimate the activity specific rate of energy expenditure of free-living cormorants. 5. To verify that the approach identifies expected trends in from situations with variable power requirements, we measured ODBA in free-living imperial cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) during foraging trips. We compared ODBA during return and outward foraging flights, when birds are expected to be laden and not laden with captured fish, respectively. We also examined changes in ODBA during the descent phase of diving, when power requirements are predicted to decrease with depth due to changes in buoyancy associated with compression of plumage and respiratory air. 6. In free-living imperial cormorants, ODBA, and hence estimated VO2, was higher during the return flight of a foraging bout, and decreased with depth during the descent phase of a dive, supporting the use of accelerometry for the determination of activity-specific rate of energy expenditure.},

Free-ranging dogs can negatively interact with wildlife at multiple levels, posing issues for biodiversity conservation in tropical forests, especially in fragmented Atlantic Forest. To optimize future control programs, it is necessary to identify the main factors influencing their habitat use, particularly in natural reserves. We combined camera trapping data and occupancy models to characterize habitat use of dogs in six Atlantic Forest protected areas (134-36,000 ha). Our results show that dogs were more likely to use sites ({\^{}} {\'{E}} ! 0.90) having higher housing density (!4.00 houses/km 2) or higher proportion of croplands and pasture (!75{\%}) relative to sites with no houses ({\^{}} {\'{E}} ¼ 0.23 AE 0.10) or lower proportion of croplands and pasture ({\^{}} {\'{E}} ¼ 0.34 AE 0.08). In addition, dogs had higher detection probability at camera locations on unpaved roads ({\^{}} p ¼ 0.33 AE 0.05) relative to off-road sites ({\^{}} p ¼ 0.18 AE 0.04), and in small protected areas with high housing density, that is, more disturbed sites, dogs had higher detection probabilities. Our findings indicate that the probability of dogs using a site within protected area is mainly driven by type and intensity of human activity in the surroundings. Given the urgent need to control free-ranging dogs within protected areas, we strongly recommend that managers target sites/areas within and near protected areas that have a rural housing density ! 4.00 houses/km 2 or higher proportion of croplands and pasture (!75{\%}).},

abstract = {One of the largest groups of snakes is the family Colubridae. This is a paraphyletic assemblage that includes a few venomous species, but most pose no special health risk to humans. Thirty to forty percent of colubrids possess a Duvernoy's gland, a specialized oral gland located in the temporal region. Although it is a homologue to the venom glands of viperid and elapid snakes, the Duvernoy's gland is anatomically and functionally distinct. Generally it lacks a large internal reservoir of secretion, emptying is under low-pressure flow, and the secretion is not delivered via hollow fangs. In contrast, true venom glands hold a large store of ready venom, expel the venom under direct action of striated muscles, and inject it as a high-pressure pulse via hollow fangs. Both the Duvernoy's gland and the venom gland are part of a snake's trophic system, involved primarily in predatory behavior. True venoms are composed of potent toxins whose main biological role is to bring about rapid prey death.Although the secretion from the Duvernoy's gland may include toxins, surprisingly only a few colubrids deploy it similarly to kill prey quickly. In fact, the biological role(s) of Duvernoy's secretion remain today largely unknown. Therefore, it is mis- leading, in a functional and evolutionary context, automatically to call Duvernoy's secretion a venom (biological role) when only its pharmacology (property) is known. Although Duver- noy's secretion has some components in common with true venoms, some may be fundamentally different in chemical com- position, likely because it is involved in different biological roles than a true venom. This means it likely includes novel chemical components with a promise of interest to human medicine.},

Both species are wide-ranging terrestrial predators of a similar size and may differentiate their ecological niche by utilizing alternative foraging strategies resulting in dietary separation. Because varanid lizards are an important group of terrestrial high-order predators in the Old World, any such separation may have important implications for faunal community structure. In total, 169 scat and stomach samples were analyzed revealing extensive dietary overlap between the species. Dietary intake was not distinguishable between species or related to individual body size. Invertebrates were most important in terms of frequency and volume, although reptiles, mammals and birds were also commonly identified. Dietary partitioning is not the mechanism allowing these congeneric varanid lizards to coexist.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. As the global population of free-ranging domestic dogs grows, there is increasing concern about impacts on human health and wildlife conservation. Effective management of dog populations requires reliable information on their diet, feeding behavior, and social ecology. Free-ranging dogs are reliant on humans, but anthropogenic food subsidies, particularly human faeces (i.e., coprophagy) have not previously been fully quantified. In this study we assess the contributions of different food types to the diet, and their influences on the social behaviour of free-ranging dogs in communal lands of rural Zimbabwe, with a focus on coprophagy. Free-ranging dog diets, body condition, and sociology were studied amongst 72 dogs over 18 months using scat analysis and direct observations. Human faeces constituted the fourth most common item in scats (56{\%} occurrence) and contributed 21{\%} by mass to the observed diet. Human faeces represented a valuable resource because relative to other food items it was consistently available, and of higher nutritional value than ‘sadza' (maize porridge, the human staple and primary human-derived food), yielding 18.7{\%} crude protein and 18.7 KJ/kg gross energy, compared to 8.3{\%} and 18.5 KJ/kg for sadza, respectively. Human faeces had protein and energy values equivalent to mammal remains, another important food item. Dog condition was generally good, with 64{\%} of adult females and 74{\%} of adult males in the highest two body condition scores (on a five point scale), suggesting a plentiful and high quality food supply. Dogs largely fed alone, perhaps as a consequence of the small, inert, and spatially dispersed items that comprise their diet, and its abundance. We discuss the relationships between sanitation, human development, the supply of human faeces, female dog fertility, and population control.},

abstract = {Conservation biologists have reported growing evidence of food-web interac- tions as causes of species endangerment. Apparent competition is an indirect interaction among prey species mediated by a shared predator, and has been increasingly linked to declines of prey species across taxa.We review theoretical and empirical studies of apparent competition, with specific attention to the mechanisms of asymmetry among apparently competing prey species. Asym- metry is theoretically driven by niche overlap, species fitness traits, spatial heterogeneity and generalist predator behavior. In real-world systems, human- induced changes to ecosystems such as habitat alteration and introduced species may be ultimate sources of species endangerment. However, apparent competi- tion is shown to be a proximate mechanism when resultant changes introduce or subsidize abundant primary prey for predator populations. Demonstration of apparent competition is difficult due to the indirect relationships between prey and predator species and the potential for concurrent exploitative competition or other community effects. However, general conclusions are drawn concerning the characteristics of prey and predator species likely to exhibit asymmetric apparent competition, and the options for recovering endangered species. While short-term management may be required to avoid imminent extinction in systems demonstrating apparent competition, we propose adaptive conservation efforts directed at long-term recovery.},

Observations of this event were made possible by the use of radio-telemetry and infrared-triggered camera traps. Only one offspring was recorded from this birth event and the period of maternal care was approximately 3 to 4 mo. A total of 3 natal dens were used throughout the monitoring period, and hollows of large trees ({\textgreater}50 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) were associated with all dens. The 100 and 95{\%} home range estimated by minimum convex polygons is 6.97 and 5.63 ha, respectively. The daily active period of the pangolin was 127 13.1 min, and peak activity levels were between 03:00 and 06:00 h. The findings of this report are discussed in relation to the conservation challenges confronting this species.},

abstract = {Top-predators have been reported to have an important role in structuring food webs and maintaining ecological processes for the benefit of biodiversity at lower trophic levels. This is thought to be achieved through their suppressive effects on sympatric mesopredators and prey. Great scientific and public interest surrounds the potential use of top-predators as biodiversity conservation tools, and it can often be difficult to separate what we think we know and what we really know about their ecological utility. Not all the claims made about the ecological roles of top-predators can be substantiated by current evidence. We review the methodology underpinning empirical data on the ecological roles of Australian dingoes (Canis lupus dingo and hybrids) to provide a comprehensive and objective benchmark for knowledge of the ecological roles of Australia's largest terrestrial predator. From a wide variety of methodological flaws, sampling bias, and experimental design constraints inherent to 38 of the 40 field studies we assessed, we demonstrate that there is presently unreliable and inconclusive evidence for dingoes' role as a biodiversity regulator. We also discuss the widespread (both taxonomically and geographically) and direct negative effects of dingoes to native fauna, and the few robust studies investigating their positive roles. In light of the highly variable and context-specific impacts of dingoes on faunal biodiversity and the inconclusive state of the literature, we strongly caution against the positive management of dingoes in the absence of a supporting evidence-base for such action. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In Italy, standards for the management of free-roaming dogs (FRDs) are defined by regional norms, generating a high variability of approaches around the country. Despite efforts carried out by the competent authorities, FRDs are still a reality impacting upon animal health and welfare and public costs. A similar scenario can be found in many other Mediterranean and Balkan counties. Here we present 14 years of data (2000–2013) retrieved from the admission dog registry of a public shelter (PS) responsible for the collection of stray dogs from one Italian province. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the local FRD population, identifying its source and to evaluate the effectiveness of the actions implemented by the local authorities. In the investigated period, 7,475 dogs were admitted to the PS. Despite the intense sterilisation plan (mean 381.7 sterilisations per year), the overall number of dogs entering PS did not decrease consistently across the years. Results highlighted a lack of responsibility of owners by failing to sterilise and identify their dogs and allowing intact animals to roam free, therefore producing uncontrolled and unwanted litters. The current dog population management strategy, based on both sheltering and capture-neuter-release programmes, is insufficient to tackle the straying phenomenon. Educational and sterilisation programmes should be an integral part of a successfully implemented FRD control plan. Our results provide further insight on free-roaming dog population dynamics and control systems, and may have important implications for many other local contexts across Europe trying to overcome the straying phenomenon.},

abstract = {Intraguild (IG) predation is an important factor influencing community structure, yet factors allowing coexistence of IG predator and IG prey are not well understood. The existence of spatial refuges for IG prey has recently been noted for their importance in allowing coexistence. However, reduction in basal prey availability might lead IG prey to leave spatial refuges for greater access to prey, leading to increased IG predation and fewer opportunities for coexistence. We determined how the availability of prey affected space-use patterns of bobcats (Lynx rufus, IG prey) in relation to coyote space-use patterns (Canis latrans, IG predators). We located animals from fall 2007 to spring 2009 and estimated bobcat home ranges and core areas seasonally. For each bobcat relocation, we determined intensity of coyote use, distance to water, small mammal biomass, and mean small mammal biomass of the home range during the season the location was collected. We built generalized linear mixed models and used Akaike Information Criteria to determine which factors best predicted bobcat space use. Coyote intensity was a primary determinant of bobcat core area location. In bobcat home ranges with abundant prey, core areas occurred where coyote use was low, but shifted to areas intensively used by coyotes when prey declined. High spatial variability in basal prey abundance allowed some bobcats to avoid coyotes while at the same time others were forced into more risky areas. Our results suggest that multiple behavioral strategies associated with spatial variation in basal prey abundance likely allow IG prey and IG predators to coexist.},

abstract = {The habitat of a population of coastal goannas (Varanus panoptes) was assessed at Fog Bay, Australia, by a combination of scat analysis, radio tracking, burrow counts, and sightings. Tracks were followed to assess spatial and temporal beach use. Scat analyses showed that goannas ate a variety of prey from the beach and dunes. Sea turtle eggs were the dominant prey found in scats during the dry season. All four census methods showed that goannas selected the beach habitat and dunes, although habitat selection indices were highest for the beach. Goannas used the beach throughout the year with peak beach activity occurring in May and November. There was no indication that sea turtle nesting influenced the timing of beach activities or how long goannas spent on the beach. The seasonal activity patterns of V. panoptes at Fog Bay is unlike V. panoptes in other areas and appears to be related to food availability. Although goannas prey on a large portion of sea turtle nests on the Fog Bay mainland, more research is required on the demography of the sea turtles to assess whether this has impacts on the size of the sea turtle populations},

By November-December, bark-stripping became progressively more important. This activity accounted for 36.5{\%} of the yearly feeding time.

abstract = {Quantifying animals' home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

abstract = {Domestic cats (Felis catus) are efficient and abundant non-native predators. Predation by domestic cats remains a topic of considerable social and scientific debate and warrants attention using improved methods. Predation is likely a function of cat behavior, opportunity to hunt, and local habitat. Previous predation studies relied on homeowner reports of wildlife captures from prey returns to the household and other indirect means. We investigated hunting of wildlife by owned, free-roaming cats in a suburban area of the southeastern USA. Specific research goals included: (1) quantifying the frequency of cat interactions with native wildlife, (2) identifying common prey species of suburban cats, and (3) examining predictors of outdoor behavior. We monitored 55 cats during a 1-year period (November 2010-October 2011) using KittyCam video cameras. Participating cats wore a video camera for 7-10 total days and all outdoor activity was recorded for analysis. We collected an average of 38. h of footage from each project cat. Forty-four percent of free-roaming cats hunted wildlife, of which reptiles, mammals, and invertebrates constituted the majority of prey. Successful hunting cats captured an average of 2.4 prey items during 7. days of roaming, with Carolina anoles (Anolis carolinensis) being the most common prey species. Most wildlife captures (85{\%}) occurred during the warm season (March-November in the southern USA). Twenty-three percent of cat prey items were returned to households; 49{\%} of items were left at the site of capture, and 28{\%} were consumed. Our results suggest that previous studies of pet cat predation on wildlife using owner surveys significantly underestimated capture rates of hunting cats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rats have reached about 80{\%} of the world's islands and are among the most successful invasive mammals. Rats are opportunistic predators that are notorious for their impact on a variety of animal and plant species. However, little documented evidence on the complexities of these interactions is available. In our study, we assessed the impact of black rats Rattus rattus introduced on a small uninhabited island with a relatively simple ecosystem, Surprise Island, New Caledonia. We also compared the diet of R. rattus in the presence and absence of breeding seabirds, assessing the dietary compensation for this potentially important food source. From 2002 to 2005, we used live trapping studies combined with stable isotope analysis and conventional diet analyses (direct observations, gut and faecal contents) to characterize the diet of rats. Our results suggest a heavy predatory impact on seabirds, which could constitute as much as 24{\%} of the rat diet. Moreover, in the absence of birds, rats compensated marginally by preying more heavily on other components of their diet but mostly acquired a new resource. They shifted their diet by preying heavily upon another endangered species, the hatchlings of sea turtles Chelonia mydas, which could constitute the main resource in the diet of R. rattus in those periods. Abundance, body condition and distribution of the rats were consistent with heavy predation upon this additional resource. Synthesis and applications. In island ecosystems invasive rats prey mainly upon seabird eggs and chicks, thereby threatening their populations. Although rats are certainly capable of surviving on terrestrial foods outside the seabird nesting season, their ability to prey upon ephemeral but abundant resources, such as hatchling sea turtles, may contribute to maintaining their populations. This may explain their success on Surprise Island, an ecosystem of extreme conditions, and suggests that biologists and managers working with threatened species should be aware of the possibility of temporary diet shifts by introduced rodents that may cause unexpected heavy predation on these species. This dietary shift from one endangered taxa to another has major implications for the conservation of seabirds and sea turtles world-wide and more generally for the biodiversity of invaded insular communities.},

The vector of the dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may be a better proxy so this study compared ODBA and VeDBA as proxies for rate of oxygen consumption using humans and 6 other species. Twenty-one humans on a treadmill ran at different speeds while equipped with two loggers, one in a straight orientation and the other skewed, while rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) was recorded. Similar data were obtained from animals but using only one (straight) logger. In humans, both ODBA and VeDBA were good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.88, although ODBA accounted for slightly but significantly more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P{\textless}0.03). There were no significant differences between ODBA and VeDBA in terms of the change in VO2 estimated by the acceleration data in a simulated situation of the logger being mounted straight but then becoming skewed (P = 0.744). In the animal study, ODBA and VeDBA were again good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.70 although, again, ODBA accounted for slightly, but significantly, more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P{\textless}0.03). The simultaneous contraction of muscles, inserted variously for limb stability, may produce muscle oxygen use that at least partially equates with summing components to derive DBA. Thus, a vectorial summation to derive DBA cannot be assumed to be the more 'correct' calculation. However, although within the limitations of our simple study, ODBA appears a marginally better proxy for VO2. In the unusual situation where researchers are unable to guarantee at least reasonably consistent device orientation, they should use VeDBA as a proxy for VO2.},

In attempting to estimate COG, it was assumed that, as with juvenile and adult fish, energy is allocated in an additive fashion with respect to routine metabolism and mass-specific COG remains constant during early life. According to this model, there should be a direct relationship between metabolic intensity and specific growth rate. 3. In chinook salmon, however, there was no significant relationship between the two variables during embryonic development, during larval development, or during the combined embryonic-larval period at any of the four test temperatures (5-0, 7.5, 10-0 and 12 5 0C). 4. The lack of correlation between metabolic intensity and specific growth rate suggests that the assumptions underpinning the additive model of energy partitioning may not hold during early life.

Our collated data cover 24 studies where GPS collars were used in 280 deployments on 13 species, including dingoes or other wild dogs (Canis lupus dingo and hybrids), cats (Felis catus), foxes (Vulpes vulpes), kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus), livestock guardian dogs (C. l. familiaris), pademelons (Thylogale billardierii), possums (Trichosurus cunninghami), quolls (Dasyurus geoffroii and D. maculatus), wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus and Petrogale lateralis), and wombats (Vombatus ursinus). Common problems encountered were associated with collar design, the GPS,VHFand timed-release components, and unforseen costs in retrieving and refurbishing collars. We discuss the implications of collar failures for research programs and animal welfare, and suggest how these could be avoided or improved. Our intention is to provide constructive advice so that researchers and manufacturers can make informed decisions about using this technology, and maximise the many benefits of GPS while reducing the risks.},

abstract = {Heterospecific communication signals sometimes convey relevant information for animal survival. For example, animals use or eavesdrop on heterospecific alarm calls concerning common predators. Indeed, most observations have been reported regarding anti-predator strategies. Use of heterospecific signals has rarely been observed as part of a foraging strategy. Here, I report empirical evidence, collected using playback experiments, showing that Japanese sika deer, Cevus nippon, use heterospecific food calls of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata yakui, for foraging efficiency. The deer and macaques both inhabit the wild forest of Yakushima Island with high population densities and share many food items. Anecdotal observations suggest that deer often wait to browse fruit falls under the tree where a macaque group is foraging. Furthermore, macaques frequently produce food calls during their foraging. If deer effectively obtain fruit from the leftovers of macaques, browsing fruit fall would provide a potential benefit to the deer, and, further, deer are likely to associate macaque food calls with feeding activity. The results showed that playback of macaque food calls under trees gathered significantly more deer than silence control periods. These results suggest that deer can associate macaque food calls with foraging activities and use heterospecific calls for foraging efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Animals frequently interrupt their activity to look up and to scan their surrounding enviromnent for potential predators (vigilance). As vigilance and other activities are often mutually exclusive, such behaviours are at the expense of feeding, sleeping or preening. Authors of many wildlife disturbance studies found that people with free-running dogs provoked the most pronounced disturbances (e.g. greater flushing distances and more birds affected). However, dogs on leash may also negatively affect wild animals, and barking dogs may lead to an increase in vigilance. In this study, I tested this hypothesis in coots (Fulica atra) using three different playback procedures: (1) dog barks, (2) conspecific coot alarm calls and (3) chaffinch song. The trials were conducted in spring and autumn 2005 at three study sites in southwestern Germany. During the dog playbacks, vigilance increased significantly from 17 to 28{\%}. This increase in vigilance is comparable to the presence of a natural predator. As expected, vigilance also increased significantly during conspecific coot alarm calls but not during playbacks of the chaffinch song control. Two main findings result from the study: (1) coots respond to acoustic traits of dogs and may be able to acoustically recognise this predator and (2) this increase in vigilance might have implications for conservation, especially when considering buffer zones around sensitive areas.},

abstract = {Mass mortality of amphibians has occurred globally since at least the early 1990s from viral pathogens that are members of the genus Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae. The pathogen infects multiple amphibian hosts, larval and adult cohorts, and may persist in herpetofaunal and osteichthyan reservoirs. Environmental persistence of ranavirus virions outside a host may be several weeks or longer in aquatic systems. Transmission occurs by indirect and direct routes, and includes exposure to contaminated water or soil, casual or direct contact with infected individuals, and ingestion of infected tissue during predation, cannibalism, or necrophagy. Some gross lesions include swelling of the limbs or body, erythema, swollen friable livers, and hemorrhage. Susceptible amphibians usually die from chronic cell death in multiple organs, which can occur within a few days following infection or may take several weeks. Amphibian species differ in their susceptibility to ranaviruses, which may be related to their co-evolutionary history with the pathogen. The occurrence of recent widespread amphibian population die-offs from ranaviruses may be an interaction of suppressed and na{\"{i}}ve host immunity, anthropogenic stressors, and novel strain introduction. This review summarizes the ecological research on amphibian ranaviruses, discusses possible drivers of emergence and conservation strategies, and presents ideas for future research directions. We also discuss common pathological signs of ranaviral disease, methods for diagnostic evaluation, and ranavirus surveillance methods. In as much as ranaviral disease is listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health and is a threat to amphibian survival, we recommend that biosecurity precautions are implemented by nations to reduce the likelihood of transporting ranavirus virions among populations. Biosecurity precautions include disinfecting footwear and equipment that comes in contact with surface water inhabited by amphibians and testing commercially shipped amphibians for the pathogen. We also encourage natural resource organizations to establish routine surveillance programs for ranaviruses in wild amphibian populations.},

abstract = {Based on a review of most recent data analyses on resource selection by animals as well as on recent suggestions that indicate the lack of an unified statistical theory that shows how resource selection can be detected and measured, the authors suggest that the concept of resource selection function (RSF) can be the base for the development of a theory. The revision of discrete choice models (DCM) is suggested as an approximation to estimate the RSF when the choice of animal or groups of animals involves different sets of available resource units. The definition of RSF requires that the resource which is being studied consists of discrete units. The statistical method often used to estimate the RSF is the logistic regression but DCM can also be used. The theory of DCM has been well developed for the analysis of data sets involving choices of products by humans, but it can also be applicable to the choice of habitat by animals, with some modifications. The comparison of the logistic regression with the DCM for one choice is made because the coefficient estimates of the logistic regression model include an intercept, which are not presented by the DCM. The objective of this work was to compare the estimates of the RSF obtained by applying the logistic regression and the DCM to the data set on habitat selection of the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) in the north west of the United States.Baseado em revis{\~{a}}o mais recente de an{\'{a}}lises de dados em sele{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de recurso pelos animais e com as mais recentes sugest{\~{o}}es, que indicam a falta de uma teoria estat{\'{i}}stica unificada que mostre como a sele{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do recurso pode ser detectada e medida, os autores sugerem que o conceito da fun{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da sele{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do recurso (RSF) pode ser a base do desenvolvimento da teoria.

This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories.

Considerable resources are expended to manage both introduced and native mammalian carnivores to improve conservation outcomes; however, management can result in unforeseen and sometimes catastrophic outcomes. Varanid lizards are likely to be apex- or mesopredators, but being reptiles are rarely considered by managers and researchers when investigating the impacts of mammalian carnivore management. Instances of mesopredator release have been described for Varanus gouldii as a result of fox and cat management in Australia, with cascading effects on faunal community structure. A meta-analysis showing extensive dietary niche overlap between varanids, foxes and cats plus a review of experimental and circumstantial evidence suggests mesopredator release of V. gouldii and about five other medium to large species of varanid lizard is likely in other regions. This highlights the need for managers to adopt a whole-of-community approach when attempting to manage predators for sustained fauna conservation, and that additional research is required to elucidate whether mesopredator release of varanids is a widespread consequence of carnivore management, altering the intended faunal responses.},

The effect of crayfish density, food level (trout eggs), and habitat complexity on prey consumption by crayfish was quantified in the laboratory. There was a significant difference in the consumption rate between different food levels. When food was scarce, almost all trout eggs were consumed regardless of crayfish density or habitat complexity.  When food was unlimited, there was a significant positive linear relationship between eggs consumed per crayfish and habitat complexity. However, the relationship was not significant when trials without habitat were deleted from the analysis. We found that habitat complexity significantly reduced intraspecific aggression. Our findings suggest that a minimal amount of habitat complexity can reduce interactions among predators, ultimately resulting in increased prey consumption.},

abstract = {Bioacoustics is historically a discipline that essentially focuses on individual behaviour in relation to population and species evolutionary levels but rarely in connection with higher levels of ecological complexity like community, landscape or ecosystem. However, some recent bioacoustic researches have operated a change of scale by developing acoustic indices which aim is to characterize animal acoustic communities and soundscapes. We here review these indices for the first time. The indices can be divided into two classes: the $\alpha$ or within-group indices and the $\beta$ or between-group indices. Up to 21 $\alpha$ acoustic indices were proposed in less than six years. These indices estimate the amplitude, evenness, richness, heterogeneity of an acoustic community or soundscape. Seven $\beta$ diversity indices were suggested to compare amplitude envelopes or, more often, frequency spectral profiles. Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ indices reported congruent and expected results but they may still suffer some bias due, for instance, to anthropic background noise or variations in the distances between vocalising animals and the sensors. Research is still needed to improve the reliability of these new mathematical tools for biodiversity assessment andmonitoring. We recommend the contemporary use of some of these indices to obtain complementary information. Eventually, we foresee that this new field of research which tries to build bridges between animal behaviour and ecology should meet an important success in the next years for the assessment and monitoring of marine, freshwater and terrestrial biodiversity from individual-based level to landscape dimension. {\textcopyright} S.

abstract = {Summary 1. Although conceptually robust, it has proven difficult to find practical measures of niche width that are simple to obtain, yet provide an adequate descriptor of the ecological position of the population examined. 2. Trophic niche has proven more tractable than other niche dimensions. However, indices used as a proxy for trophic niche width often suffer from the following difficulties. Such indices rarely lie along a single scale making comparisons between populations or species difficult; have difficulty in combining dietary prey diversity and evenness in an ecologically meaningful way; and fail to integrate diet over ecological time-scales thus usually only comprise single snapshots of niche width. 3. We propose an alternative novel method for the comparison of trophic niche width: the use of variance of tissue stable isotope ratios, especially those of nitrogen and carbon. 4. This approach is a potentially powerful method of measuring trophic niche width, particularly if combined with conventional approaches, because: it provides a single measure on a continuous axis that is common to all species; it integrates information on only assimilated prey over time; the integration period changes with choice of tissue sampled; and data production is theoretically fast and testing among populations simple. 5. Empirical studies are now required to test the benefits of using isotopic variance as a measure of niche width, and in doing so help refine this approach.},

Because of the difficulties in defining what is available from an animal's perspective for many species, statistical approaches such as first-passage time (FPT) analysis have been developed, which explore habitat-use intensities through the areas used by animals. In this study, we expand on that approach by using FPT-derived data within the framework of mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models (CPH models) to quantify habitat selection. By modelling FPTs, CPH models evaluate which habitat attributes best explain the 'risk' or 'hazard' of the animal leaving an area of a given radius. For quantitative interpretations, the coefficients of the CPH model can be used to calculate hazard ratios that estimate relative habitat preferences: the lower the hazard ratio (i.e. the lower the risk of leaving), the higher the preference. Accounting for individual variability in habitat use by means of a random-effect term added to CPH models provides inferences that more appropriately reflect the typical hierarchical structure of telemetric data on animal space use. Synthesis and applications. In addition to providing inferences about habitat selection based on the estimated parameters, survival functions of fixed-effects CPH models can be used to construct spatial predictions, for instance maps of population-level space use. Such predictions can be particularly useful for applied purposes, for example as a basis for species conservation plans and reserve selection. The method is illustrated using two data sets from marine mammal species: ringed seals Phoca hispida and white whales Delphinapterus leucas, but it is broadly applicable to habitat selection and prediction studies of other highly mobile animals in marine or terrestrial systems.},

abstract = {This study used coyote howl surveys combined with GIS to locate local coyote (Canis latrans) populations, determine the habitats where coyotes occur and estimate coyote group sizes in Bedford, North Chagrin and West Creek Reservations within the Cleveland Metroparks, Ohio. The CMP were established in 1917 and are the oldest park districts in the state of Ohio. There are 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) of land in 16 reservations and in 2008 approximately 43,000,000 people visited the Cleveland Metroparks. Bedford, North Chagrin and West Creek Reservations have a mixture of park, forest, woodlots, residential neighborhoods, industrial areas, commercial property, open water, streams and wetlands. Coyotes have become the {\`{i}}top terrestrial predator{\^{i}} in northeastern North America and these animals are choosing to live in urban areas where humans are present and few natural habitats are available. Very little is known about the ecology and behavior of these elusive Canids around residential neighborhoods. I examined where coyotes actually lived along park boundaries. I performed howl surveys in Bedford, North Chagrin, and West Creek Reservations. Data were collected to determine coyote location, estimation of coyote group sizes and what types of habitats coyotes responded from. Overall, coyotes were heard 16.9{\%} of the time when howl surveys were performed. Bedford Reservation had a minimum of 13 coyotes during winter months and 11 coyotes during the summer. It is believed that three coyote groups (Bedford, Cuyahoga Valley National Park and Walton vii Hills) were present around Bedford Reservation. North Chagrin Reservation had at least five coyotes during the winter and four coyotes in the summer months. West Creek Reservation had three coyotes respond to surveys in the winter and five coyotes replied during summer surveys. North Chagrin and West Creek Reservation each had one coyote group. Bedford Reservation coyote groups had similar responses during all three seasons (dispersal, breeding and pup-rearing). North Chagrin coyotes responded the most during the dispersal and pup-rearing seasons. West Creek Reservation had peak coyote responses during the breeding and pup-rearing seasons. For all three reservations, coyotes responded from natural areas more than from urban areas (Bedford 65{\%}, North Chagrin 79{\%}, and West Creek 83{\%}). Statistics showed that Bedford coyotes responded more than West Creek coyotes. More coyotes responded during the dispersal season than during the pup-rearing season. Coyote response rates increased the closer howl surveys were performed to sunset and/or later at night (closer to midnight). Coyotes also responded more to howl surveys when temperatures were low and the moon was visible. Overall, howl surveys allowed for inexpensive monitoring of coyotes over large areas in urban-park environments. Coupled with GIS, these surveys identified where coyotes lived and the habitats they used, and therefore these methods provide the tools to inform the public better about how they may coexist with coyotes.},

Males had much larger home ranges than females, but only males reduced their ranges significantly in the dry season. Home ranges overlapped a little between individuals, but their core areas were not overlapped suggesting territoriality. Taiwanese leopard cats in our study area tended to avoid large artificial open areas like agriculture land and man-made construction. Movement analyses showed that males were more mobile than females, but females used their home range in a more concentrated manner. They were nocturnal and exhibited crepuscular activity patterns in the wet season, but were arrhythmic in the dry season. Nocturnal activity was low during the dry season.

abstract = {Sorry, there is no abstract available. Read the first few lines of the text instead! In many prey species the potential disadvantages of foraging in a group can be outweighed by shared responsibility for vigilance [for a review, see [1]]. One of the major functional explanations for the evolution of sociality in animals is that individuals in groups can decrease the amount of time they allocate to vigilance without increasing the risk of death through predation. Within a group, animals can share vigilance, while keeping constant or increasing the probability of detecting approaching predators (the 'many eyes' hypothesis [2]). Accordingly, a decrease in individual levels of vigilance with increasing group size has been reported for many species of birds and mammals [reviews in [1, 3, 4]]. This phenomenon has also been interpreted in relation to competition between group members for the exploitation of limited and ephemeral food supplies [5, 6], but the precise effect of intragroup competition on vigilance remains unclear. As Lima [3]emphasizes, the fact that individual vigilance during sleeping has been reported to decrease with group size in doves [7]tends to support the 'many eyes' hypothesis, because competition for sleep seems rather unlikely [8]. On the other hand, in dunlins (Calidris alpina) the number of vigilance bouts is affected by group size during foraging but not during preening [9].},

abstract = {The behavioral plasticity of locusts is a striking trait presented during the reversible phase transition between solitary and gregarious individuals. However, the results of serotonin as a neurotransmitter from the migratory locust Locusta migratoria in phase transition showed an alternative profile compared to the results from the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria. In this study, we investigated the roles of serotonin in the brain during the phase change of the migratory locust. During the isolation of gregarious nymphs, the concentration of serotonin in the brain increased significantly, whereas serotonin receptors (i.e., 5-HT 1 , 5-HT 2 , and 5-HT 7 ) we identified here showed invariable expression patterns. Pharmacological intervention showed that serotonin injection in the brain of gregarious nymphs did not induced the behavioral change toward solitariness, but injection of this chemical in isolated gregarious nymphs accelerated the behavioral change from gregarious to solitary phase. During the crowding of solitary nymphs, the concentration of serotonin in the brain remained unchanged, whereas 5-HT 2 increased after 1 h of crowding and maintained stable expression level thereafter. Activation of serotonin-5-HT2 signaling with a pharmaceutical agonist inhibited the gregariousness of solitary nymphs in crowding treatment. These results indicate that the fluctuations of serotonin content and 5-HT 2 expression are results of locust phase change. Overall, this study demonstrates that serotonin enhances the solitariness of the gregarious locusts. Serotonin may regulate the withdrawal-like behavioral pattern displayed during locust phase change and this mechanism is conserved in different locust species.},

abstract = {Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) can undergo a profound transformation between solitarious and gregarious forms, which involves widespread changes in behaviour, physiology and morphology. This phase change is triggered by the presence or absence of other locusts and occurs over a timescale ranging from hours, for some behaviours to change, to generations, for full morphological transformation. The neuro-hormonal mechanisms that drive and accompany phase change in either direction remain unknown. We have used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to compare amounts of 13 different potential neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators in the central nervous systems of final instar locust nymphs undergoing phase transition and between long-term solitarious and gregarious adults. Long-term gregarious and solitarious locust nymphs differed in 11 of the 13 substances analysed: eight increased in both the brain and thoracic nerve cord (including glutamate, GABA, dopamine and serotonin), whereas three decreased (acetylcholine, tyramine and citrulline). Adult locusts of both extreme phases were similarly different. Isolating larval gregarious locusts led to rapid changes in seven chemicals equal to or even exceeding the differences seen between long-term solitarious and gregarious animals. Crowding larval solitarious locusts led to rapid changes in six chemicals towards gregarious values within the first 4 h (by which time gregarious behaviours are already being expressed), before returning to nearer long-term solitarious values 24 h later. Serotonin in the thoracic ganglia, however, did not follow this trend, but showed a ninefold increase after a 4 h period of crowding. After crowding solitarious nymphs for a whole larval stadium, the amounts of all chemicals, except octopamine, were similar to those of long-term gregarious locusts. Our data show that changes in levels of neuroactive substances are widespread in the central nervous system and reflect the time course of behavioural and physiological phase change.},

The diet of domestic dogs was dominated by barley husks and human faeces which contributed 45{\%} and 20.7{\%} of the total 382 meals observed during focal watch observations.

Both focal watch and faecal analyses revealed that rodents contributed only a very small proportion of the diet of dogs accounting for only 4.2{\%} of the focal watch and 2.8{\%} of the faecal analysis of roaming dogs. As Ethiopian wolves fed almost exclusively on rodent year round, no significant exploitative competition between dogs and wolves were assessed.

abstract = {The trade-up hypothesis outlines a behavioural strategy that females could use to maximize the genetic benefits to their offspring. The hypothesis proposes that females should be more willing to accept a mate when the new male encountered is a superior genetic source to previous mates. We provide a direct test of the trade-up hypothesis using guppies (Poecilia reticulata), and evaluate both behavioural and paternity data. Virgin female guppies were presented sequentially with two males of varying attractiveness, and their responsiveness to each male was quantified. Male attractiveness (ornamentation) was scored as the amount of orange coloration on their body. Females were generally less responsive to second-encountered males, yet responsiveness to second males was an increasing function of male ornamentation. These attractive second males also sired a greater proportion of the offspring. There was an overall tendency for last-male advantage in paternity, and this advantage was most exaggerated when the second male was more ornamented than the first. Finally, we found that our estimate of relative sperm number did not account for any significant variation in paternity. Our results suggest that female guppies may use pre-copulatory mechanisms to maximize the genetic quality of their offspring.},

abstract = {Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of animals in the wild would revolutionize our ability to study and conserve ecosystems. We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could transform many fields of biology, ecology, and zoology into "big data" sciences. Motion sensor "camera traps" enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2-million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with over 93.8{\%} accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3{\%} of the data while still performing at the same 96.6{\%} accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving more than 8.4 years (at 40 hours per week) of human labeling effort (i.e. over 17,000 hours) on this 3.2-million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains immediately highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images. Our results suggest that this technology could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.},

abstract = {Although domestic dogs play many important roles in rural households, they can also be an important threat to the conservation of wild vertebrates due to predation, competition and transmission of infectious diseases. An increasing number of studies have addressed the impact of dogs on wildlife but have tended to ignore the motivations and attitudes of the humans who keep these dogs and how the function of dogs might influence dog-wildlife interactions. To determine whether the function of domestic dogs in rural communities influences their interactions with wildlife, we conducted surveys in rural areas surrounding protected lands in the Valdivian Temperate Forests of Chile. Sixty percent of farm animal owners reported the use of dogs as one of the primary means of protecting livestock from predators. The probability of dog-wild carnivore interactions was significantly associated with the raising of poultry. In contrast, dog-wild prey interactions were not associated with livestock presence but had a significant association with poor quality diet as observed in previous studies. Dog owners reported that they actively encouraged the dogs to chase off predators, accounting for 25-75{\%} of the dog-wild carnivore interactions observed, depending on the predator species. Humans controlled the dog population by killing pups and unwanted individuals resulting in few additions to the dog population through breeding; the importation of predominantly male dogs from urban areas resulted in a sex ratios highly dominated by males. These results indicate that dog interactions with wildlife are related to the role of the dog in the household and are directly influenced by their owners. To avoid conflict with local communities in conservation areas, it is important to develop strategies for managing dogs that balance conservation needs with the roles that dogs play in these rural households.},

abstract = {The cane toad Bufo marinus has been migrating westward across northern Australia since its introduction as a biological control agent in 1935. It has been implicated in the widespread decline of many native frog-eating predators. To investigate the impacts of this invasive species on native predatory reptiles, annual surveys were conducted from 2001 to 2007 to document variation in the relative abundances of three varanid lizards (Varanus mertensi, Varanus mitchelli and Varanus panoptes) and one crocodile Crocodylus johnstoni species known to consume toads. In addition, the indirect effects of this variation on one agamid lizard Amphibolurus gilberti, a known prey item of V. panoptes, were also examined. Surveys were performed at two sites in northern Australia before and after the arrival of B. marinus. Significant declines in the relative abundances of all three species of varanid lizard were observed following toad arrival. Declines in the abundance of V. panoptes, V. mitchelli and V. mertensi at the two sites ranged 83-96, 71-97 and 87-93{\%}, respectively. In contrast, A. gilberti increased by 23-26{\%}; whereas there were no significant population-level declines in C. johnstoni despite observations of individual effects (i.e. several dead crocodiles with B. marinus in their stomachs). These findings suggest population-level changes in Australian lizards caused by an invasive species.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) are the most abundant mammalian carnivores worldwide. Given that domestic carnivores rely on human-provided food, their densities are usually independent of prey densities. Nevertheless, underfed pets may need to hunt to meet their energetic and nutritional requirements. We explored the effects of different levels of care (provision of food) of dogs and cats on their predation rates on wild vertebrates in 2 areas of southern Chile. We interviewed cat and dog owners and analyzed prey remains in scats of pets to examine how domestic dogs and cats were managed and to gather information on the wild vertebrates killed and harassed by pets. We used logistic regression to examine the association between pet care and the frequency of wild vertebrate remains in scats. The probability of a dog preying on vertebrates was higher for poorly fed than for adequately fed dogs (odds ratio = 3.7) and for poorly fed than for adequately fed cats (odds ratio = 4.7). Domestic dogs and cats preyed on most endemic and threatened mammals present in the study sites. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the less care domestic animals receive from owners the higher the probability those animals will prey on wild vertebrates.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses a number of issues related to measuring poverty over time. It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Zoological Society of London. Domestic dogs are increasingly being recognized as a conservation threat for native species. In many places, their impacts may be as severe as other invasive predators such as cats and rats. We conducted the first ever sub-continent scale assessment of the impacts of dogs on native species in India using an online key informant survey and reports from national print media. Dogs reportedly attacked 80 species, of which 31 were IUCN Red list threatened species, including four Critically Endangered species. Larger bodied mammals such as ungulates and carnivores, were most commonly reported to be attacked, although this may be an observation bias. Approximately 68{\%} of the attacks were carried out by dogs unaccompanied by humans. Most of the attacks were carried out by packs of dogs with 45{\%} of these attacks leading to the death of the prey. Nearly 48{\%} of the incidents were reported in and around wildlife protected areas, suggesting that dogs are an important large-scale edge effect around protected areas in India. For Critically Endangered species that are already suffering from serious population declines due to other causes, the impact of dogs may seriously impede population recovery efforts. Mitigating the impacts of dogs on wildlife requires a multi-pronged approach of responsible dog ownership, restriction in free-ranging behaviour, and strong population control measures, especially around sensitive conservation areas.},

Direct counts maintained over long time periods are extremely difficult to achieve. Indices of population sizes can be used to estimate large carnivore abundances, but are often case-, species- and site-specific. Here, we test the general applicability of track-based indices to estimate large carnivore abundance. We surveyed 15 306.4 km of roads associated with 339 transects across a wide geographical scale, large range of densities and variable substrates for tracks of African large carnivores. A combined model for all carnivore species on sandy soils serves as a robust approach to predict large carnivore densities. Thus, indices based on track counts can provide useful estimates of carnivore abundance. We found consistent relationships between track densities and the actual carnivore densities, having taken account of substrate.},

abstract = {We used a spatially explicit population model of wolves (Canis lupus) to propose a framework for defining rangewide recovery priorities and finer-scale strategies for regional reintroductions. The model predicts that Yellowstone and central Idaho, where wolves have recently been successfully reintroduced, hold the most secure core areas for wolves in the western United States, implying that future reintroductions will face greater challenges. However, these currently occupied sites, along with dispersal or reintroduction to several unoccupied but suitable core areas, could facilitate recovery of wolves to 49{\%} of the area in the western United States that holds sufficient prey to support wolves. That percentage of the range with recovery potential could drop to 23{\%} over the next few decades owing to landscape change, or increase to 66{\%} owing to habitat restoration efforts such as the removal of some roads on public lands. Comprehensive habitat and viability assessments such as those presented here, by more rigorously defining the Endangered Species Act's concept of "significant portion of range," can clarify debate over goals for recovery of large carnivores that may conflict with human land uses. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

abstract = {From 1983, there have been three decades of the application and development of radio telemetry for wildlife studies in India. In this article, we review 82 studies from India, covering 47 species from four taxonomic classes. We examine and discuss the trends in the selection of study species, habitats and objectives of radio-telemetry studies and the functional success of radio collars and tags. A strong bias for study species and study region is observed and researchers generally tend not to look beyond the traditional research questions. Habitats that are difficult to access, such as the Trans-Himalayas, the Himalayas and north-eastern India, are overlooked. Most of the studies aimed to infer primary information only, such as home range, migration and movement patterns and habitat preference (53.7{\%}, 47.6{\%} and 28.1{\%} studies, respectively). We expect these trends to change with time as the development of technology allows researchers to explore further. We investigated the tracking histories of 483 animals and the records of 496 radio collars or tags, but detailed information could be acquired for only 330 collars or tags. Of the collars, 49{\%} malfunctioned before the end of their anticipated life due to a variety of reasons, early battery drainage being the prevalent cause. The performance of different technologies and collar manufacturers was also analysed but the small sample size was an issue for most of the cases. Argos-based collars and tags generally failed to record most of the locations precisely and failed to transmit them successfully. Issues with permissions and capturing animals for tagging, particular to India, are also discussed. A uniform and centralized system for granting permissions and guidelines for capturing and handling animals would be beneficial to future telemetry studies.},

abstract = {In the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), males have two alternative mating tactics. Individual males may either display to a receptive female prior to attempting to copulate with her or attempt to quickly sneak-copulate with a female without first displaying to her or without a prior receptive response from her. In this study, I experimentally investigated the effects of simulated local increases in the risk of predation (in the form of a cichlid fish predator model in situ) on the mating tactics used by free-ranging male guppies in two typical macrohabitats (riffle and pool) of a Trinidadian river. Focal male guppies displayed to females significantly less often on average, and conversely attempted sneak copulations more often, in the presence of the predator model than in its absence; this pattern was similar for both habitats. These fish therefore performed a lower proportion of sigmoid displays and increased their sneaky mating attempts when the apparent risk of predation had increased locally. This predator-mediated response is consistent with a trade-off between mating success and risk of mortality due to predation. The results are the first to confirm risk-sensitive mating behaviour in free-ranging male guppies within a population, and demonstrate the potential importance of predators in influencing the relative use of alternative mating tactics in this species on a microgeographical scale in the wild.},

abstract = {The metabolic costs of animal movement have been studied extensively under laboratory conditions, although frequently these are a poor approximation of the costs of operating in the natural, heterogeneous environment. Construction of "energy landscapes," which relate animal locality to the cost of transport, can clarify whether, to what extent, and how movement properties are attributable to environmental heterogeneity. Although behavioral responses to aspects of the energy landscape are well documented in some fields (notably, the selection of tailwinds by aerial migrants) and scales (typically large), the principles of the energy landscape extend across habitat types and spatial scales. We provide a brief synthesis of the mechanisms by which environmentally driven changes in the cost of transport can modulate the behavioral ecology of animal movement in different media,develop example cost functions for movement in heterogeneous environments, present methods for visualizing these energy landscapes, and derive specific predictions of expected outcomes from individual-to population and species-level processes. Animals modulate a suite of movement parameters (e.g., route, speed, timing of movement, and tortuosity) in relation to the energy landscape, with the nature of their response being related to the energy savings available. Overall,variation in movement costs influences the quality of habitat patches and causes nonrandom movement of individuals between them. This can provide spatial and/or temporal structure to a range of population-and species level processes, ultimately including gene flow. Advances in animalattached technology and geographic information systems are opening up new avenues for measuring and mapping energy landscapes that are likely to provide new insight into their influence in animal ecology. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

We investigate the effects of household and road proximity, and of dog population size in the surroundings on the invasion of cacao agroforest by dogs, and evaluate if dogs raised in the vicinity are more likely to invade agroforests than dogs of unknown origin. The study was conducted in a landscape dominated by agroforests, within the cacao growing region of Southern Bahia, Brazil. Dogs were recorded by camera-traps in 15 agroforest sites, and we identified dogs inhabiting the vicinity of each sampled agroforest site by visiting all households up to 800 m from sampling sites. We obtained 115 photographic records of 47 individuals, and identified 213 dogs inhabiting the site surroundings. The number of individuals and frequency of visit of dogs tend to be higher in agroforests located nearer a household, but were not associated with the distance to the nearest road or the dog population size in the surroundings. The frequency of visits in agroforests did not differ between dogs residing in the surroundings and dogs of unknown origin. Our results indicate that the surroundings are not the main source of dogs invading agroforests, most likely because dogs perform long-distance movements in association to humans. Strategies to reduce the impacts of dogs on wildlife will gain from studies on movement ecology and should include practices to restrict dogs' home range.},

abstract = {Radiotelemetry has become one of the most valuable ﬁ eld techniques in wildlife ecology because it allows biologists to collect location and other data remotely. This method is an especially important tool for studying the behaviour and demography of species that are often secretive, traverse large areas, and occur at low densities. Although use of radiotelemetry for studying tropical carnivores has been limited, this is changing rapidly. However, to maximise the value of radiotelemetry for learning about and managing tropical carnivores, biologists need to understand this technique and important considerations in its application. Radiotelemetry studies can provide useful information when biologists clearly articulate their objectives, carefully select study designs, evaluate important assumptions, apply appropriate analytical methods, and interpret the results properly. The choice of equipment and methods often must consider challenges such as remote study areas dominated by dense vegetation. Appropriate methods of attaching transmitters are critical, as is the assumption that transmitters have no signiﬁ cant effects on study animals. The development of GPS radiotelemetry allows investigators to examine movements at high resolution, but VHF systems often remain the most appropriate or only feasible option for many studies of tropical carnivores. Methods for analysing radiotelemetry data also have expanded greatly in sophistication and explanatory power. Some of the most important analytical developments are in the shift from simple descriptive statistical approaches to process-based models that directly incorporate mechanistic hypotheses. Throughout this overview, we outline general advantages and disadvantages of various study options and emphasise the importance of testing key biological and methodological assumptions appropriate for each technique at all stages in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of radio-tracking data.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic resource subsidies have contributed to the dramatic increase in the abundance of Common Ravens (Corvus corax) in the western Mojave Desert, California, during the past 30 years. To better understand the effects of these subsidies on raven demography, we examined whether survival to juvenile departure from the natal territory could be predicted by a set of environmental and morphological variables, such as nest proximity to anthropogenic resources and juvenile condition. We captured 240 juvenile ravens over 2 years and marked them prior to fledging. Nest proximity to anthropogenic resources and earlier fledging dates significantly predicted raven juvenile survival to departure from the natal territory. The best-fitting mark-recapture models predicted postdeparture survival as a function of time since fledging, nest proximity to anthropogenic resources, and year hatched. The positive effect of nest proximity to anthropogenic resources influenced postdeparture survival for at least 9 months after fledging, as revealed by the mark-recapture analysis. Annual survival was 47{\%} for first-year, 81{\%} for second-year, and 83{\%} for third-year birds. Our results support the hypothesis that anthropogenic resources contribute to increasing raven numbers via increased juvenile survival to departure as well as increased postdeparture survival. We expect raven numbers to grow in concert with the growing human presence in the Mojave Desert unless raven access to anthropogenic resources is diminished.},

abstract = {Insects and other invertebrates form a portion of many living and extinct primate diets. We review the nutritional profiles of insects in comparison with other dietary items, and discuss insect nutrients in relation to the nutritional needs of living primates. We find that insects are incorporated into some primate diets as staple foods whereby they are the majority of food intake. They can also be incorporated as complements to other foods in the diet, providing protein in a diet otherwise dominated by gums and/or fruits, or be incorporated as supplements to likely provide an essential nutrient that is not available in the typical diet. During times when they are very abundant, such as in insect outbreaks, insects can serve as replacements to the usual foods eaten by primates. Nutritionally, insects are high in protein and fat compared with typical dietary items like fruit and vegetation. However, insects are small in size and for larger primates ({\textgreater}1kg) it is usually nutritionally profitable only to consume insects when they are available in large quantities. In small quantities, they may serve to provide important vitamins and fatty acids typically unavailable in primate diets. In a brief analysis, we found that soft-bodied insects are higher in fat though similar in chitin and protein than hard-bodied insects. In the fossil record, primates can be defined as soft- or hard-bodied insect feeders based on dental morphology. The differences in the nutritional composition of insects may have implications for understanding early primate evolution and ecology. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Throughout many regions of the tropics, non-primate animals - mainly birds and mammals - have been observed to follow primate groups and to exploit dropped food and flushed prey. The anecdotal nature of most of the numerous reports on these primate-non-primate associations (PNPAs) may obscure the biological significance of such associations. We review the existing literature and test predictions concerning the influence of primate traits (body size, activity patterns, dietary strategies, habitat, group size) on the occurrence of PNPAs. Furthermore, we examine the influence of non-primates' dietary strategies on the occurrence of PNPAs, and the distribution of benefits and costs. We detected a strong signal in the geographic distribution of PNPAs, with a larger number of such associations in the Neotropics compared to Africa and Asia. Madagascar lacks PNPAs altogether. Primate body size, activity patterns, habitat and dietary strategies as well as non-primate dietary strategies affect the occurrence of PNPAs, while primate group size did not play a role. Benefits are asymmetrically distributed and mainly accrue to non-primates. They consist of foraging benefits through the consumption of dropped leaves and fruits and flushed prey, and anti-predation benefits through eavesdropping on primate alarm calls and vigilance. Where quantitative information is available, it has been shown that benefits for non-primates can be substantial. The majority of PNPAs can thus be categorized as cases of commensalism, while mutualism is very rare. Our review provides evidence that the ecological function of primates extends beyond their manifold interactions with plants, but may remain underestimated.},

abstract = {Habitat choice and interactions of foraging shorebirds and gulls were studied at a migratory stopover in Delaware Bay, New Jersey. Foraging, vigilance, aggressive behavior, and habitat choice of shorebirds were affected by the presence of gulls. There were significant differences in the time each species devoted to actively feeding; knots spent significantly less time foraging than did the other species. Birds congregated in the habitats where their foraging rates were the highest. When turnstones and laughing gulls fed in larger conspecific flocks, they had higher foraging times. Red knots were most aggressive toward laughing gulls, turnstones were most aggressive toward herring gulls, sanderlings were most aggressive toward turnstones, and semipalmated sandpipers were most aggressive toward knots. There were significant differences in habitat use: 1) Gulls and turnstones were more abundant along the tide line, 2) turnstones were more abundant on the upper beach, 3) semipalmated sandpipers and turnstones were more abun- dant on sandbars, 4) only gulls fed on the beach mud, and 5) laughing gulls and semipalmated sandpipers were more common along creeks than were the other species. Within 5 minutes of a human disturbance, gulls returned to predisturbance levels, while the shorebirds did not. Shorebirds responded most strongly to the presence of dogs than to other disturbances and did not return to beaches following a disturbance by a dog. These observations suggest that there may be some competition for foraging space among foraging species, especially between the shorebirds and the larger gulls, that human disturbance affects shore- birds more strongly than gulls, and that shorebirds and gulls use the habitats differently. The data can be used to manage human disturbance and to protect habitats where the shorebirds have the highest foraging rates, but the least exposure to gulls.},

During the summers of 2003-2004, 5 detection teams located 1,565 scats (747 putative black bear, 665 putative fisher, and 153 putative bobcat) at 168 survey sites throughout Vermont, USA. Of 347 scats genetically analyzed for species identification, 179 (51.6{\%}) yielded a positive identification, 131 (37.8{\%}) failed to yield DNA information, and 37 (10.7{\%}) yielded DNA but provided no species confirmation. For 70 survey sites where confirmation of a putative target species' scat was not possible, we assessed the probability that {\textgreater}= 1 of the scats collected at the site was deposited by the target species (probability of correct identification; P-ID). Based on species confirmations Or PID values, we detected bears at 57.1{\%} (96) of sites, fishers at 61.3{\%} (103) of sites, and bobcats at 12.5{\%} (21) of sites. We estimated that the mean probability of detecting the target species (when present) during a single visit to a site was 0.86 for black bears, 0.95 for fishers, and 0.40 for bobcats. The probability of detecting black bears was largely unaffected by site- or visit-specific covariates, but the probability of detecting fishers varied by detection team. We found little or no effect of topographic ruggedness, vegetation density, or local weather (e.g., temp, humidity) on detection probability for fishers or black bears (data were insufficient for bobcat analyses). Detection dogs were highly effective at locating scats from forest carnivores and provided an efficient and accurate method for collecting detection-nondetection data on multiple species.},

This change can occur within the lifetime of a single locust and accrues across generations. It represents an extreme example of phenotypic plasticity. We present computer simulations and a laboratory experiment that show how differences in resource distributions, conspicuous only at small spatial scales, can have significant effects on phase change at the population level; local spatial concentration of resource induces gregarization. Simulations also show that populations inhabiting a locally concentrated resource tend to change phase rapidly and synchronously in response to altered population densities. Our results show why information about the structure of resource at small spatial scales should become key components in monitoring and control strategies.},

abstract = {Interactions between top predators and mesopredators of the same guild often result in habitat segregation restricting interactions to shared habitat edges. Although negative edge effects are recognized as important spatial patterns in the ecology of fragmented landscapes, the underlying mechanisms of predator-prey interactions resulting in negative edge effects remain unknown. To disentangle top-down effects of intraguild predators and bottom-up effects of shared resources on mesopredator spatial distribution, we recorded the occurrence of tawny owls Strix aluco in forests and their prey, the little owl Athene noctua in adjacent open areas over 2 yr across 687 km2 in Southern Germany. We developed a new, asymmetrical dynamic two-species occupancy model investigating spatial interactions while accounting for imperfect detection. Little owl occupancy was strongly reduced within 150 m of forests, but only in the presence of tawny owls. Analysis of over 30 000 telemetry locations of 275 little owls showed that little owls strongly avoided areas closer than 150 m from the forest during range use. These results suggest that the negative edge effect is due to forest edge avoidance rather than direct predation. Potential confounding mechanisms such as food depletion or habitat avoidance at forest edges can be ruled out. Thus, top-down effects caused by avoidance of intraguild top predators shape the spatial distribution of mesopredators such as the little owl. While habitat complexity mitigates multitrophic interactions within habitats, it is expected to reinforce multitrophic interactions between habitats, potentially leading to the suppression of mesopredators from suitable habitats.},

The Gray Wolf is the largest canid and their roles in food webs are much researched, as are those of Domestic Dogs, Coyotes and Red Foxes. Much less is known about the other canid species and their ecological roles.Here we describe general food web theory and the potential application of network theory to it; summarise the possible roles of predators in food webs; document the occurrence, diet and presumed functions that canids play in food webs throughout the world; give case studies of four threatened canid species of top, middle and basal trophic positions and six anthropogenically affected species; and identify knowledge limitations and propose research frameworks necessary to establish the roles of canids in food webs.Canids can be top-down drivers of systems or responsive to the availability of resources including suitable prey. They can be affected anthropogenically by habitat change, lethal control and changes to basic resource availability. They can be sustainable yield harvesters of their indigenous prey or passengers in complex ecosystems, and some are prey of larger canids and of other predators. Nevertheless, the roles of most canids are generally poorly studied and described, and some, e.g. Gray Wolves, Coyotes and Australian dingoes, are controversial. We advocate mensurative and experimental research into communities and ecosystems containing canids for a quantitative understanding of their roles in food webs and consequent development of better management strategies for ecosystems.},

abstract = {Territorial defense and maintenance are an important facet of the social ecology of most carnivore species. From January 1991 to June 1993, we observed 54 coyotes (Canis latrans) for 2507 h in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, during which we observed 112 instances of territory defense. The identity of the coyotes involved in challenging and evicting intruding animals was known. Alpha coyotes were most likely to be involved in territorial evictions of intruding animals, followed by beta individuals; pups participated little in territory defense. Coyotes evicting intruders generally had a numerical advantage when challenging the intruders. Territory-defense rates were highest during and immediately after the breeding season and during the time of pup emergence from the den. All chases of intruders ended at the boundary of the resident coyote pack's territory. Physical contact between the intruding animal and resident pack members occurred with no intruders being killed or seriously injured. Physical contact consisted of fighting and ritualized behaviors, with only a few instances in which fighting led to blood being drawn or minor injuries to the intruder. Most encounters resulted in a hasty retreat from the area by the intruder(s). While indirect means of territory maintenance (i.e., howling and scent-marking) were utilized by resident packs, trespassing still occurred and direct confrontation was needed to enforce boundaries and assert occupancy against other resident packs, as well as against lone intruders seeking territory vacancies. Territoriality was advantageous in that territory holders generally had higher survival rates (except pups), contributed all the reproductive effort to the population, and had greater access to food resources. In contrast, nonterritorial animals had lower survival rates, did not breed, and had reduced access to food (ungulate carcasses) during winter.},

abstract = {The subsidization of predators occurs when humans directly or indirectly alter resource availability in such a way as to increase the density of a predator population above levels that would occur without the additional resources. Subsidized predators can drastically impact prey populations because subsidies insulate the predator populations from the effects of declines in prey populations (Sinclair et al., 1998). Such scenarios become problematic for conservation practitioners when the enhanced predator population influences species of conservation concern. Examples of this are widespread: subsidized ravens influence tortoise ecology (Boarman, 2003); subsidized predatory beetles influence insect herbivore populations (Rand {\&} Louda, 2006); subsidized mountain lions influence bighorn sheep demographics (Rominger et al., 2004); and in the example presented by Shapira, Sultan {\&} Shanas (2008), subsidized red foxes Vulpes vulpes influence gerbil ecology.},

abstract = {Zahavi's handicap theory, formalized by Grafen, suggests that 'cheaters' must be at a disadvantage if a communication system such as ritualized aggression is to evolve (Grafen 1991, In: Behavioural Ecology: An Evolutionary Approach (Ed. by J. R. Krebs {\&} N. B. Davies), pp. 5-31. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific). To determine whether cheating is disadvantageous in Betta splendens, we held a series of live interactions, after inducing hyper-aggression by socially isolating and then briefly 'priming' the fish. Primed isolates, which were no stronger than their rivals, 'cheated' by escalating rapidly to tailbeating and biting. These cheaters, however, usually lost fights to non-isolated opponents. Unprimed isolates, i.e. socially isolated fish that were not primed, were not initially hyper-aggressive and thus did not cheat. They lost fewer fights than the cheaters. Results suggested that cheaters lost because they exhausted themselves by their hyper-aggressiveness, allowing their non-hyper-aggressive opponents to win. This result is consistent with the Zahavi-Grafen model of how an 'honest' level of ritualized aggression can be stabilized in a population.

abstract = {One of the consequences of fragmentation is a combination of increased proximity to human dominated areas and an influx of free-roaming dogs. In fragmented habitats those dogs are expected to have a considerable impact on ungulate populations since conditions are, in effect, similar to alien species on islands. We studied the impact of free-roaming dogs (Canis familiaris) on the kid/mother ratio of mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella gazella) in an isolated area heavily disturbed by human activity. We used the kid/female ratio as an index of recruitment in the gazelle populations and evaluated the impacts of dog presence, intensity of human disturbance, and forage and cover availability on this ratio over space and time. Data were collected from direct observations. Overall, kid/female ratio in the area is too low for population growth; a finding that is in agreement with drive counts indicating a consistent decline over the past four years (1998-2001). Our results show that free-roaming dogs were the overwhelming factor affecting kid/female ratio in this area. Gazelles responded positively and quickly to dog culling. Thus, free-roaming dogs appear to be a considerable threat to the gazelle population in the study area. Removal of those dogs on a regular basis is an adequate short-term management protocol for increasing gazelle recruitment rate. However, a permanent solution would require reducing the number of dogs by limiting human waste disposal. These results suggest that, in addition to the loss of habitat and connectivity, free-roaming dogs can be a major threat to native ungulates in human dominated fragmented landscapes. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, nonindigenous species sometimes interact to worsen each other's impact. These impacts are commonly seen in national parks throughout the United States. The key policy change required to alleviate this threat is it shift from blacklists of prohibited species and it presumption of harmlessness to combinations of white and blacklists and a presumption that any species may be damaging. This new guiding philosophy must be inculcated at international and national levels. which will not be easy during a period when free trade is seen as an unmitigated blessing. Within the United States. enhanced cooperation and coordination will be required among all parties (i.e., federal, state, kind local agencies as well as private entities) charged with managing invasions. Internationally, the key forum is the World Trade Organization. Various management tools available to combat nonindigenous species have produced some striking successes, but new research could improve their effectiveness and reliability. There is a particular need for research on ecosystem management to control introduced species. In the face of the increasingly publicized onslaught of invaders, there is a widespread tendency to view increased biotic homogenization as inevitable. However, advances in both policy and technology, could greatly slow this process and perhaps (in concert with restoration measures) even reverse it. The necessary pressure and resources to effect these changes must come from an increasingly alarmed and vocal public.},

Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

abstract = {Australian examples of surplus killing by mammalian predators were collated. These included surplus killing of native mammals and birds by foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and stock, native mammals and native birds by dingoes (Canis lupus dingo). We found no examples of surplus killing by feral cats (Felis catus). Incidents collated include historical anecdotes of surplus killing by foxes as they colonised the Australian mainland, recent examples where foxes killed threatened native species at sites despite intensive management to exclude foxes, and recent examples of the killing of native species on formerly fox-free islands to which foxes gained entry. Episodes of surplus killings by foxes, other than predation on captive or closely confined animals, appeared different in kind and frequency to those documented for co-evolved predator-prey systems on the large continental landmasses. They did not appear to be uncommon events associated with synchronised births of prey species, unusual or extreme weather that disadvantaged prey species, or seasonal food caching by a predator. Rather, surplus killing events appeared to reflect ineffective anti-predator defences by prey species when encountering a novel and efficient predator to which they have had no evolutionary exposure. We suggest that surplus killing by foxes may have been a feature of, and major contributor to, the rapid mainland extinction or contraction in range of many native species in Australia. In contrast to foxes, examples of surplus killing by dingoes relate mostly to domestic stock (calves and sheep). The arrival of dingoes to the Australian continent preceded that of foxes by 3500-4000 years, but they appear not to have had the dire impact on native mammals that we attribute to foxes. This may be due to fundamental differences in hunting styles and prey size and to their sparse populations in pre-European Australia. Active persecution of non-commensal dingoes by Aborigines, the lack of free-water, and the absence of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as an alternative food supply would have limited their numbers and their impact on native mammals. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The pellet-group counting method has been used to evaluate density of the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). This species is an important component of human diet in tropical habitats. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare density estimates using four methods: counts in circular plots (FSC, Fecal Standing Crop and FAR, Fecal Accumulation Rate), and counts in transects (LT, Line Transect and ST, Strip Transect); 2) simulate the effect of increased sampling effort on density and precision, and; 3) evaluate the effort required to detect changes in population density using LT. From 2006 to 2007, we intensively sampled a 1 km2 quadrant in a Mexican tropical dry forest. The results indicate that all four methods produce similar mean population density estimates. However, estimates of precision were dependent on sample size which in turn was associated with the particular counting method used. In descending order of estimate precision, the methods ranked as: LT, ST, FSC, and FAR. To detect population changes of {\textless} 20{\%}, we suggest the establishment of 5 to 22 transects (LT) of 390 m during the dry season.

By using random forests for classifying behavioural patterns of beavers from accelerometry data, we were able to distinguish seven behaviours; standing, walking, swimming, feeding, grooming, diving and sleeping. We show how to apply the use of acceleration to determine behaviour, and emphasise the ease with which this non-invasive method can be implemented. Furthermore, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this, and the implementation of accelerometry on animals, illustrating limitations, suggestions and solutions. Ultimately, this approach may also serve as a template facilitating studies on other animals with similar locomotor modes and deliver new insights into hitherto unknown aspects of behavioural ecology.},

On the mainland the species is also listed as nationally endangered and more information is needed to direct any meaningful conservation effort. In this study we aimed to elucidate quolls' spatial requirements and activity patterns using GPS collars on 10 males and 4 females. Quolls were predominantly nocturnal but some individuals showed pronounced daytime activity. There was no apparent seasonal shift in the timing of activity. The movement of quolls appeared to be confined to home ranges that were relatively large for predators of their size. Furthermore, males used home ranges about three times as large as that of the smaller females. There appeared to be some spatial segregation between not only females, which have been considered territorial, but also males. Overall, it is likely that the larger areas used by males is partly caused by the sexual dimorphism in body mass that entails differences in prey requirements and spectrum, but probably is also a function of a promiscuous mating system. All of these could explain the observed more unidirectional movement and larger distances travelled per day by males.},

Interviews revealed that the majority of local herders believed dogs have only a minor impact on saiga due to the low density of domestic dogs and the lack of feral dogs in the reserve. However, dogs are believed to have greater impacts on saiga in harsh winters, when saiga are in poorer health and are more likely to use areas where dogs are present. Thus, domestic dogs in the study area appear to have no regular detrimental impact on the local saiga population, but may act as a source of additive mortality in years},

abstract = {* If animals moved randomly in space, the use of different habitats would be proportional to their availability. Hence, deviations from proportionality between use and availability are considered the tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection Functions). * Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly, habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been collected. * Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts with the distribution and availability of other habitats. * We demonstrate the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. * An appealing aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the model. This feature is likely to improve model prediction, hint at the mechanism of habitat selection, and may signpost habitats that are critical for the organism's fitness.},

We review analytical methods for dealing with correlated data in the context of resource selection, including post hoc variance inflation techniques, 'two-stage' approaches based on models fit to each individual, generalized estimating equations and hierarchical mixed-effects models. These methods are applicable to a wide range of correlated data problems, but can be difficult to apply and remain especially challenging for use-availability sampling designs because the correlation structure for combinations of used and available points are not likely to follow common parametric forms. We also review emerging approaches to studying habitat selection that use fine-scale temporal data to arrive at biologically based definitions of available habitat, while naturally accounting for autocorrelation by modelling animal movement between telemetry locations. Sophisticated analyses that explicitly model correlation rather than consider it a nuisance, like mixed effects and state-space models, offer potentially novel insights into the process of resource selection, but additional work is needed to make them more generally applicable to large datasets based on the use-availability designs. Until then, variance inflation techniques and two-stage approaches should offer pragmatic and flexible approaches to modelling correlated data.},

abstract = {Several crayfish species behave as biological invaders. Their establishment in an area has frequently been accompanied by the reduction or elimination of indigenous species. A laboratory study was designed to investigate whether the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) is dominant over the indigenous (to Delaware) crayfish Procambarus acutus acutus (Girard, 1852) in either the absence or the presence of a shelter as a limited resource. As expected, we found that P. clarkii is more aggressive than the similarly sized P. a. acutus, thus confirming previous studies that demonstrated an inherent dominance of the invasive over the indigenous crayfish. We then hypothesized that species showing a lower preference for an offered shelter (P. clarkii) should be less motivated to defend it. To the contrary, in a competitive context P. clarkii excluded P. a. acutus from the shelter but did not use the resource. Caution must be used in extrapolating these laboratory studies to the field, and future studies should analyze multiple factors, including the autoecology of the two species and their reproductive potential and recruitment patterns. However, our results might help in highlighting the risks for freshwater biodiversity created by the uncontrolled translocations of P. clarkii and other similar invasive species. ..LAN-FR Plusieurs esp√{\textregistered}ces d'√{\textcopyright}crevisses se comportent comme des envahisseurs biologiques.

abstract = {A growing international concern for the welfare of animals, combined with the need to capture and handle specific species for conservation, management, or recreational purposes, is increasing the need for scientific evaluation of capture methods. We evaluated the efficiency, selectivity, and injury of cable restraint devices and cage-traps for capture of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in 4 sites of Castilla y Leon (Spain) during spring of 2006. All traps performed similarly at all sites, with no apparent site and trap interactions. Fox capture rates and mechanical efficiencies of the Belislet (Edouard Belisle, Saint Veronique, PQ , Canada) and Collarum t (Wildlife Control Supplies, East Granby, CT; mention of product names does not infer endorsement) were similar, but both had higher capture rates than the cage-trap. Similar to previous studies, the Collarum was 100{\%} selective for canids and had a selectivity of 94.4 overall, which was higher than that for the Belisle (63.4); both Collarum and Belisle were much more selective than the cage-trap (21.4). Fox injuries were statistically indistinguishable using injury scores, but the Collarum and the Belisle surpassed international standards for humane trapping; an insufficient number of animals were captured in cage-traps to allow evaluation. Both the Collarum and the Belisle may be useful for the capture of foxes in Spain, but training and experience with each may be necessary to ensure the highest efficiency while preventing injuries, especially to nontarget species},

abstract = {In the eastern white river crayfish, Procambarus acutus acutus, the processes that act during hierarchy formation were explored by analyzing the behavior of 23 symmetric pairs of form I males. The experimental design comprised three subsequent phases: isolation, familiarization, and experimental phases. In the latter, pairs were formed of (i) unfamiliar opponents having different status, (ii, iii) unfamiliar opponents having the same status, either two alphas or two betas, and (iv) familiar opponents. The first result was that P. a. acutus is capable of establishing stable dominance hierarchies. Secondly, behavioral differences between the winners and the losers, a fast assessment of status, and self-reinforcing effects of recent experience were demonstrated. Thirdly, P. a. acutus was found to recognize the status of its rival but not its individual identity. In fact, even if paired with unfamiliar opponents, previous winners and losers behaved as in the preceding days. Conversely, both frequency and intensity of fighting increased when individuals of the same rank were opposed. These phenomena might be a consequence of “winning and losing effects”. However, the increased readiness of former betas to attack contradicts the loser effect and validates the hypothesis of status recognition.},

abstract = {Top predators are declining globally, in turn allowing populations of smaller predators, or mesopredators, to increase and potentially have negative effects on biodiversity. However, detection of interactions among sympatric predators can be complicated by fluctuations in the background availability of resources in the environment, which may modify both the numbers of predators and the strengths of their interactions. Here, we first present a conceptual framework that predicts how top-down and bottom-up interactions may regulate sympatric predator populations in environments that experience resource pulses. We then test it using 2 years of remote-camera trapping data to uncover spatial and temporal interactions between a top predator, the dingo Canis dingo, and the mesopredatory European red fox Vulpes vulpes and feral cat Felis catus, during population booms, declines and busts in numbers of their prey in a model desert system. We found that dingoes predictably suppress abundances of the mesopredators and that the effects are strongest during declines and busts in prey numbers. Given that resource pulses are usually driven by large yet infrequent rains, we conclude that top predators like the dingo provide net benefits to prey populations by suppressing mesopredators during prolonged bust periods when prey populations are low and potentially vulnerable.},

abstract = {In spite of the worldwide occurrence of domestic cats and dogs, and their close relationship with humans, the number of published papers on free-ranging cats Felis catus and dogs Canis familiaris, is small. The diet of both species was estimated in a suburban and rural environment in July 2002 and January 2003. Visual observations and scat collection of both species were accomplished along a 10km transect line in the Campus Luiz de Queiroz, University of Sao Paulo, Piracicaba, south-eastern Brazil. The diet of both species was determined by analysis of sterilized, washed, dried and sorted scats. Estimated abundances of free-ranging cats and dogs in the sampled area were 81 (4.32) and 42 (2.96), respectively. Cats and dogs were more abundant in the suburban than in the rural environment (t=3.78, Po0.001, N=55; t=8.38, Po0.001, N=55, respectively) and cats were more abundant than dogs in the suburban environment (t=6.76, Po0.001, N=55), even though there was no significant difference between the abundance of both species in the rural environment (t=0.82, P=0.46, N=55). Invertebrates were the most commonly consumed item by both species, followed by mammals (cats: 63.24 and 20.51{\%}; dogs: 57.05 and 25.15{\%}, respectively). Niche breadth was 0.4892 for cats and 0.4463 for dogs. Niche overlap was almost complete (0.97108). The consumption of mammals was estimated to be between 16.76 and 25.42 kg individual1year1 for dogs and between 2.01 and 2.9 kg individual1year1 for cats. These data might be useful to establish a management program to minimize the predation pressure of free-ranging cats and dogs on wildlife.},

Here we developed a physiological SMART collar that used GPS locations and accelerometry to continuously monitor energetics, movements, and behavior of free-ranging mountain lions. This large felid displayed marked individuality in predatory movements, ranging from low energetic, sit-and-wait behaviors to constant high activity chases with transport costs averaging 2.3 times predicted for running mammals. Lions reduced hunting costs by precisely matching maximum pouncing force (ODBAmax = 5.3-16.1 g) to prey size and by using cryptic behaviors. Such instantaneous energetic costs help explain why most felids stalk-and-pounce, and provide a unique approach for conserving large, mobile predators by accurately forecasting resource demands},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

abstract = {Top carnivores have suffered widespread global declines, with well-documented effects on mesopredators and herbivores. We know less about how carnivores affect ecosystems through scavenging. Tasmania's top carnivore, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), has suffered severe disease-induced population declines, providing a natural experiment on the role of scavenging in structuring communities. Using remote cameras and experimentally placed carcasses, we show that mesopredators consume more carrion in areas where devils have declined. Carcass consumption by the two native mesopredators was best predicted by competition for carrion, whereas consumption by the invasive mesopredator, the feral cat (Felis catus), was better predicted by the landscape-level abundance of devils, suggesting a relaxed landscape of fear where devils are suppressed. Reduced discovery of carcasses by devils was balanced by the increased discovery by mesopredators. Nonetheless, carcasses persisted approximately 2.6-fold longer where devils have declined, highlighting their importance for rapid carrion removal. The major beneficiary of increased carrion availability was the forest raven (Corvus tasmanicus). Population trends of ravens increased 2.2-fold from 1998 to 2017, the period of devil decline, but this increase occurred Tasmania-wide, making the cause unclear. This case study provides a little-studied potential mechanism for mesopredator release, with broad relevance to the vast areas of the world that have suffered carnivore declines.},

abstract = {Canine aggression poses serious public health and animal welfare concerns. Most of what is understood about breed differences in aggression comes from reports based on bite statistics, behavior clinic caseloads, and experts' opinions. Information on breed-specific aggressiveness derived from such sources may be misleading due to biases attributable to a disproportionate risk of injury associated with larger and/or more physically powerful breeds and the existence of breed stereotypes. The present study surveyed the owners of more than 30 breeds of dogs using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), a validated and reliable instrument for assessing dogs' typical and recent responses to a variety of common stimuli and situations. Two independent data samples (a random sample of breed club members and an online sample) yielded significant differences among breeds in aggression directed toward strangers, owners and dogs (Kruskal-Wallis tests, P {\textless} 0.0001). Eight breeds common to both datasets (Dachshund, English Springer Spaniel, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Poodle, Rottweiler, Shetland Sheepdog and Siberian Husky) ranked similarly, rs = 0.723, P {\textless} 0.05; rs = 0.929, P {\textless} 0.001; rs = 0.592, P = 0.123, for aggression directed toward strangers, dogs and owners, respectively. Some breeds scored higher than average for aggression directed toward both humans and dogs (e.g., Chihuahuas and Dachshunds) while other breeds scored high only for specific targets (e.g., dog-directed aggression among Akitas and Pit Bull Terriers). In general, aggression was most severe when directed toward other dogs followed by unfamiliar people and household members. Breeds with the greatest percentage of dogs exhibiting serious aggression (bites or bite attempts) toward humans included Dachshunds, Chihuahuas and Jack Russell Terriers (toward strangers and owners); Australian Cattle Dogs (toward strangers); and American Cocker Spaniels and Beagles (toward owners). More than 20{\%} of Akitas, Jack Russell Terriers and Pit Bull Terriers were reported as displaying serious aggression toward unfamiliar dogs. Golden Retrievers, Labradors Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Brittany Spaniels, Greyhounds and Whippets were the least aggressive toward both humans and dogs. Among English Springer Spaniels, conformation-bred dogs were more aggressive to humans and dogs than field-bred dogs (stranger aggression: Mann-Whitney U test, z = 3.880, P {\textless} 0.0001; owner aggression: z = 2.110, P {\textless} 0.05; dog-directed aggression: z = 1.93, P = 0.054), suggesting a genetic influence on the behavior. The opposite pattern was observed for owner-directed aggression among Labrador Retrievers, (z = 2.18, P {\textless} 0.05) indicating that higher levels of aggression are not attributable to breeding for show per se. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Top-order predators often have positive effects on biological diversity owing to their key functional roles in regulating trophic cascades and other ecological processes. Their loss has been identified as a major factor contributing to the decline of biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Consequently, restoring and maintaining the ecological function of top predators is a critical global imperative. Here we review studies of the ecological effects of the dingo Canis lupus dingo, Australia's largest land predator, using this as a case study to explore the influence of a top predator on biodiversity at a continental scale. The dingo was introduced to Australia by people at least 3500 years ago and has an ambiguous status owing to its brief history on the continent, its adverse impacts on livestock production and its role as an ecosystem architect. A large body of research now indicates that dingoes regulate ecological cascades, particularly in arid Australia, and that the removal of dingoes results in an increase in the abundances and impacts of herbivores and invasive mesopredators, most notably the red fox Vulpes vulpes. The loss of dingoes has been linked to widespread losses of small and medium-sized native mammals, the depletion of plant biomass due to the effects of irrupting herbivore populations and increased predation rates by red foxes. We outline a suite of conceptual models to describe the effects of dingoes on vertebrate populations across different Australian environments. Finally, we discuss key issues that require consideration or warrant research before the ecological effects of dingoes can be incorporated formally into biodiversity conservation programs.},

The energy expended for hunting must account for this complexity but has been difficult to measure for this and other large, cryptic carnivores. Here we developed a physiological SMART collar that used GPS locations and accelerometry to continuously monitor energetics, movements, and behavior of free-ranging mountain lions. This large felid displayed marked individuality in predatory movements, ranging from low energetic, sit-and-wait behaviors to constant high activity chases with transport costs averaging 2.3 times predicted for running mammals. Lions reduced hunting costs by precisely matching maximum pouncing force (ODBAmax = 5.3-16.1 g) to prey size and by using cryptic behaviors. Such instantaneous energetic costs help explain why most felids stalk-and-pounce, and provide a unique approach for conserving large, mobile predators by accurately forecasting resource demands},

We evaluated the efficiency, selectivity, and injury of cable restraint devices and cage-traps for capture of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in 4 sites of Castilla y Leon (Spain) during spring of 2006. All traps performed similarly at all sites, with no apparent site and trap interactions. Fox capture rates and mechanical efficiencies of the Belislet (Edouard Belisle, Saint Veronique, PQ , Canada) and Collarum t (Wildlife Control Supplies, East Granby, CT; mention of product names does not infer endorsement) were similar, but both had higher capture rates than the cage-trap. Similar to previous studies, the Collarum was 100{\%} selective for canids and had a selectivity of 94.4 overall, which was higher than that for the Belisle (63.4); both Collarum and Belisle were much more selective than the cage-trap (21.4). Fox injuries were statistically indistinguishable using injury scores, but the Collarum and the Belisle surpassed international standards for humane trapping; an insufficient number of animals were captured in cage-traps to allow evaluation. Both the Collarum and the Belisle may be useful for the capture of foxes in Spain, but training and experience with each may be necessary to ensure the highest efficiency while preventing injuries, especially to nontarget species},

abstract = {Worldwide, domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are one of the most common carnivoran species in natural areas and their populations are still increasing. Dogs have been shown to impact wildlife populations negatively, and their occurrence can alter the abundance, behavior, and activity patterns of native species. However, little is known about abundance and density of the free-ranging dogs that use protected areas. Here, we used camera trap data with an open-robust design mark–recapture model to estimate the number of dogs that used protected areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We estimated the time period these dogs used the protected areas, and explored factors that influenced the probability of continued use (e.g., season, mammal richness, proportion of forest), while accounting for variation in detection probability. Dogs in the studied system were categorized as rural free-ranging, and their abundance varied widely across protected areas (0–73 individuals). Dogs used protected areas near human houses for longer periods (e.g., {\textgreater}50{\%} of sampling occasions) compared to more distant areas. We found no evidence that their probability of continued use varied with season or mammal richness. Dog detection probability decreased linearly among occasions, possibly due to the owners confining their dogs after becoming aware of our presence. Comparing our estimates to those for native carnivoran, we found that dogs were three to 85 times more abundant than ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), two to 25 times more abundant than puma (Puma concolor), and approximately five times more abundant than the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). Combining camera trapping data with modern mark–recapture methods provides important demographic information on free-ranging dogs that can guide management strategies to directly control dogs' abundance and ranging behavior. },

abstract = {Agricultural farming is a major consumer of global arable lands and has a direct effect on species decline through habitat destruction. However, agricultural endeavours can also evoke indirect threats that will result in behavioural modifications of indigenous species. In a desert ecosystem, where a political border led to a farming dichotomy between intensive cultivates in Israel and intact lands in Jordan, we compared the foraging behaviours and abundances of the red fox and two species of gerbils, close to and distant from farms, and during two moon phases. We estimated fox and gerbil foraging levels by track counts, and measured gerbil time allocation, vigilance and apprehension by the giving-up density method. While foxes were significantly more abundant and active at locations close to farms, gerbils were significantly more abundant and active at locations distant from farms. Moreover, the typical reduction in food consumption during full-moon nights was exhibited only at locations close to farms. These results could suggest that indicators of predation risk, such as illumination intensity or distance to cover, are not universal, and their effectiveness may depend indirectly on anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural farming. The results could also suggest that although intensive agricultural endeavours benefit foxes, they might increase the predatory pressure on gerbils in addition to the already known effects of habitat loss. Therefore, agriculture acts as a double-edged sword by reducing natural habitats, while at the same time changing the predator-prey natural balance. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {Many advanced snakes use fangs-specialized teeth associated with a venom gland-to introduce venom into prey or attacker. Various front- and rear-fanged groups are recognized, according to whether their fangs are positioned anterior (for example cobras and vipers) or posterior (for example grass snakes) in the upper jaw. A fundamental controversy in snake evolution is whether or not front and rear fangs share the same evolutionary and developmental origin. Resolving this controversy could identify a major evolutionary transition underlying the massive radiation of advanced snakes, and the associated developmental events. Here we examine this issue by visualizing the tooth-forming epithelium in the upper jaw of 96 snake embryos, covering eight species. We use the sonic hedgehog gene as a marker, and three-dimensionally reconstruct the development in 41 of the embryos. We show that front fangs develop from the posterior end of the upper jaw, and are strikingly similar in morphogenesis to rear fangs. This is consistent with their being homologous. In front-fanged snakes, the anterior part of the upper jaw lacks sonic hedgehog expression, and ontogenetic allometry displaces the fang from its posterior developmental origin to its adult front position-consistent with an ancestral posterior position of the front fang. In rear-fanged snakes, the fangs develop from an independent posterior dental lamina and retain their posterior position. In light of our findings, we put forward a new model for the evolution of snake fangs: a posterior subregion of the tooth-forming epithelium became developmentally uncoupled from the remaining dentition, which allowed the posterior teeth to evolve independently and in close association with the venom gland, becoming highly modified in different lineages. This developmental event could have facilitated the massive radiation of advanced snakes in the Cenozoic era, resulting in the spectacular diversity of snakes seen today.},

abstract = {Mangroves are defined by the presence of trees that mainly occur in the intertidal zone, between land and sea, in the (sub) tropics. The intertidal zone is characterised by highly variable environmental factors, such as temperature, sedimentation and tidal currents. The aerial roots of mangroves partly stabilise this environment and provide a substratum on which many species of plants and animals live. Above the water, the mangrove trees and canopy provide important habitat for a wide range of species. These include birds, insects, mammals and reptiles. Below the water, the mangrove roots are overgrown by epibionts such as tunicates, sponges, algae, and bivalves. The soft substratum in the mangroves forms habitat for various infaunal and epifaunal species, while the space between roots provides shelter and food for motile fauna such as prawns, crabs and fishes. Mangrove litter is transformed into detritus, which partly supports the mangrove food web. Plankton, epiphytic algae and microphytobenthos also form an important basis for the mangrove food web. Due to the high abundance of food and shelter, and low predation pressure, mangroves form an ideal habitat for a variety of animal species, during part or all of their life cycles. As such, mangroves may function as nursery habitats for (commercially important) crab, prawn and fish species, and support offshore fish populations and fisheries. Evidence for linkages between mangroves and offshore habitats by animal migrations is still scarce, but highly needed for management and conservation purposes. Here, we firstly reviewed the habitat function of mangroves by common taxa of terrestrial and marine animals. Secondly, we reviewed the literature with regard to the degree of interlinkage between mangroves and adjacent habitats, a research area which has received increasing attention in the last decade. Finally, we reviewed current insights into the degree to which mangrove litter fuels the mangrove food web, since this has been the subject of long-standing debate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Noninvasive camera-traps are commonly used to survey mammal communities in the Neotropics. This study used camera-traps to survey medium and large mammal diversity in the San Juan – La Selva Biological Corridor, Costa Rica. The connectivity of the corridor is affected by the spread of large-scale agriculture, cattle ranching, and a growing human presence. An occupancy modeling approach was used to estimate corridor species richness and species-specific detection probabilities in 16 forested sites within four different matrix-use categories: eco-lodge reserves, tree plantations/general reforestation, cattle ranches, and pineapple/agricultural plantations. Rarity had a highly negative effect ($\beta$ = -1.96 ± 0.65 SE) on the ability to detect species presence. Corridor richness was estimated at 20.4 ± 0.66 species and was lower than that observed in protected areas in the Neotropics. Forest cover was significantly less at pineapple plantations than other land-use matrices. Richness estimates for different land-use matrices were highly variable with no significant differences; however, pineapple plantations exhibited the highest observed richness. Given the limited forest cover at those sites, we believe that this reflects the concentrated occurrence of medium and large mammals in small forest patches, particularly because the majority of pineapple plantation communities were generalist mesopredators. Fragmentation and connectivity will need to be addressed with reforestation and limitations on pineapple production for the region to function as an effective corridor. Occupancy modeling has only recently been applied to camera-trap data and our results suggest that this approach provides robust richness and detection probability estimates and should be further explored.

The accelerometry technique offers a method for recording behaviors but interpretation of the data is not straightforward. To date, analysis of such data has either involved subjective, study-specific assignments of behavior to acceleration data or the use of complex analyses based on machine learning. Here, we present a method for automatically classifying acceleration data to represent discrete, coarse-scale behaviors. The method centers on examining the shape of histograms of basic metrics readily derived from acceleration data to objectively determine threshold values by which to separate behaviors. Through application of this method to data collected on two distinct species with greatly differing behavioral repertoires, kittiwakes, and humans, the accuracy of this approach is demonstrated to be very high, comparable to that reported for other automated approaches already published. The method presented offers an alternative to existing methods as it uses biologically grounded arguments to distinguish behaviors, it is objective in determining values by which to separate these behaviors, and it is simple to implement, thus making it potentially widely applicable. The R script coding the method is provided.},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {Use of livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) to reduce predation on livestock is increasing. However, how these dogs influence the activity of wildlife, including predators, is not well understood. We used pellet counts and remote cameras to investigate the effects of free ranging LGDs on four large herbivores (eastern gray kangaroo, common wombat, swamp wallaby, and sambar deer) and one mesopredator (red fox) in Victoria, Australia. Generalized mixed models and one- and two-species detection models were used to assess the influence of the presence of LGDs on detection of the other species. We found avoidance of LGDs in four species. Swamp wallabies and sambar deer were excluded from areas occupied by LGDs; gray kangaroos showed strong spatial and temporal avoidance of LGD areas; foxes showed moderately strong spatial and temporal avoidance of LGD areas. The effect of LGDs on wombats was unclear. Avoidance of areas with LGDs by large herbivores can benefit livestock production by reducing competition for pasture and disease transmission from wildlife to livestock, and providing managers with better control over grazing pressure. Suppression of mesopredators could benefit the small prey of those species. Synthesis and applications: In pastoral areas, LGDs can function as a surrogate top-order predator, controlling the local distribution and affecting behavior of large herbivores and mesopredators. LGDs may provide similar ecological functions to those that in many areas have been lost with the extirpation of native large carnivores.},

abstract = {On most developed coastlines, dunes backing ocean beaches constitute an urbanised landscape mosaic containing remnant pockets of small conservation areas. Urbanised beaches are also prime sites for domestic dogs, known to be environmentally harmful in many other settings. It is unknown, however, whether small, protected parcels of dune are adequate for biological conservation and whether dogs compromise their functional conservation objectives. Here we examine, for two small (2 km ocean boundary) reserves in Eastern Australia abutting an urban area, whether such small reserves can continue to function as effective conservation instruments on ocean beaches, using scavenger community composition and efficiency to assess ecosystem function. Two non-native species of canids-domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)-were ubiquitous and numerous inside conservation areas, to the point of having become the most abundant vertebrate scavengers at the beach-dune interface, outcompeting native scavengers for wave-cast carrion. Dogs and foxes have effectively supplanted raptors, normally abundant on non-urban beaches in the region, and other avian scavengers, as the principal consumers of animal carcasses both inside the declared reserves and at the urban beach. Whilst the ecological threats posed by foxes are widely and intensively addressed in Australia in the form of fox-control programs, dog controls are less common and stringent. Our data emphasize, however, that managing domestic dogs may be required to the same extent in order to maintain key forms and functions in coastal reserves situated close to urban areas.},

abstract = {Capturing animals is an essential tool of wildlife management, but the use of capture devices is being affected by public pressures on an international scale. In Europe, and particularly Spain, foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are often captured using traditional methods such as nonlocking Spanish Snares (SS) set in an ad hoc fence line known as an alar, but these traditional European methods are rarely compared to modernly described restraints such as the Wisconsin Cable Restraint (WR). We evaluated rates of efficiency, selectivity, injury, and impacts to foxes and nontarget species when using SS (as traditionally set in an alar) or WR within alars or on trails in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. During 40,372 trap-nights from summer to winter of 2007, we captured 64 foxes, and 8 of 23 potential nontarget species. Our results indicated that WR set in trails were more efficient (0.28 capture rate) for capturing red foxes than SS set in an alar (0.11 capture rate). Relative to injury, foxes captured with the WR in the alar (95.4{\%}), and WR in trails (90.5{\%}), and the SS (90.9{\%}) showed no indicators of poor welfare, and injury score analysis indicated that injuries were of similar magnitude for all capture devices. Overall, the WR set in trails may have performed the best, but all 3 methods are likely sufficient for capturing foxes with minimal injury, acceptable efficiency, and acceptable impact to foxes and sympatric nontarget species. Thus, wildlife managers in Spain and elsewhere can apply our findings to optimize capture and management of foxes.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses a number of issues related to measuring poverty over time. It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

This study was conducted in Jana Jagaran Community Forest of Parasan VDC, Kanchanpur to investigate the impacts of community forestry on V. bengalensis by studying the habitat preferences of monitors in habitats created by community forestry management activities. Fencing has had a positive impact, whereas plantations did not have a significant impact on V. bengalensis. Most lizards were observed on the ground, but the presence of both ground cover and large trees were equally important for the species. To date, community forestry has had a positive impact on V. bengalensis in the Jana Jagaran Community Forest, but further studies on the impact of plantations are recommended.},

abstract = {The mangroves from Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to Kranji Dam represent the largest intact mangrove forest left on mainland Singapore. Mangroves colonized the area around 6820 BP, as sea level rose following the last glacial maximum and a variable thickness of Holocene sands, muds and peats (generally ???1 to {\textgreater}3.8 m thick) were deposited over the pre-transgression land surface. An analysis of a time series of photographs covering the period from 1946 to 2001 has revealed major changes in the distribution of mangroves in the area resulting from development-induced changes in the local hydrodynamic regime and clearance for aquaculture. Mangroves covered 117.3 ha in the study area in 1946 and were actively advancing over the coastal mudflats until 1980. Despite the addition of 6.24 ha from mangrove colonization, the total area covered by mangroves was reduced by ???50{\%} by 1980 due to clearance for aquaculture. Following 1980, a reduction in sediment supply possibly due to the construction of the Kranji Dam, immediately east of the study area, led to the initiation of erosion along much of the coastline, with the mangrove fringe having retreated by up to 50 m in 2001. Establishment of the wetland reserve in 1992 enabled the partial regeneration of mangroves in the area to 86.8 ha, 25{\%} less than in 1946. Three areas of undisturbed old growth mangroves {\textgreater}55 years in age have been identified and are considered to be of high conservation value. Two of these areas are within the current boundaries of the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, but are located along coastal areas that are undergoing severe erosion. The third area is located in the south of the study area, protected from coastal erosion, but outside the current nature reserve boundary and hence is susceptible to loss as a result of future development. This third area is possibly the oldest undisturbed fragment of mangrove forest on mainland Singapore. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With an increasing human population and environmental degradation, the world faces a major problem in providing adequate animal based proteins. Many traditional societies have used or still use insects as a protein source, while westernized societies are reluctant to use insects, despite being the major consumers of animal proteins. We now need to consider insects as a source of food for humans in a manner that acknowledges both the role of entomophagy in indigenous societies and the need for westernized societies to reduce the size of their environmental footprint with regard to food production. The situation on continents such as Africa, Asia, and Central and South America has some parallels to Australia in that there are two forces in operation: the sustainable traditional use of edible insects and the "westernization" of these societies leading to a movement away from entomophagy. However, the potential to reach a compromise is greater in these continents because entomophagy is already accepted. The major challenges will be establishing sustainable production systems that include food safety and security as well as environmental protection. Whether this will happen or not will depend upon: (i) a major change in attitude in westernized societies towards entomophagy; (ii) pressure to conserve remaining habitats in a sustainable manner; (iii) economic impetus to develop food production systems that include insects; and (iv) an acknowledgement that achieving adequate nutrition on a global basis will involve different diets in much of the developed world.},

abstract = {Crotalus viridis, the western rattlesnake, ranges throughout western North America and has been divided into at least eight subspecies. However, the validity of and relationships among these subspecies and the monophyly of C. viridis as a whole are questionable. We used mitochondrial DNA sequence data from the D-loop region and ND2 gene to examine the relationships among 26 populations of C. viridis and to test the monophyly of this species. These data were analyzed separately and combined using maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony. The C. viridis group was monophyletic in all combined analyses, consisting of two strongly divergent clades. We recommend that these clades be recognized as two distinct evolutionary species: C. viridis and C. oreganus. Crotalus viridis should be restricted to the subspecies viridis and nuntius and the remaining subspecies be assigned to the species C. oreganus. Our data do not allow strong evaluation of the validity of the subspecies. We found that the ND2 gene had greater sequence divergences among closely related individuals than the D-loop region, but this relationship reversed at higher levels of divergence. This pattern is apparently due to: (1) ND2 third positions evolving faster than the D-loop but becoming saturated at higher levels of divergence, and (2) the D-loop evolving faster than ND2 second (and possibly first) positions. Our results suggest that the ND2 gene is preferable for examining intraspecific relationships and the D-loop may better resolve relationships between species of snakes. The latter result is contrary to the common perception of the phylogenetic utility of the D-loop. Another unusual result is that the 145 bp spacer region, adjacent to the 5' end of the light strand of the D-loop, provides greater phylogenetic resolution than the 1030 bp D-loop.},

abstract = {Abstract Most mammalian populations suffer from natural or human-induced disturbances; populations are no longer at the equilibrium (i.e., at stable [st]age distribution) and exhibit transient dynamics. From a literature survey, we studied patterns of transient dynamics for mammalian species spanning a large range of life-history tactics and population growth rates. For each population, we built an age-structured matrix and calculated six metrics of transient dynamics. After controlling for possible confounding effects of the phylogenetic relatedness among species using a phylogenetic principal component analysis and phylogenetic generalized least squares models, we found that short-term demographic responses of mammalian populations to disturbance are shaped by generation time and growth rate. Species with a slow pace of life (i.e., species with a late maturity, a low fecundity, and a long life span) displayed decreases in population size after a disturbance, whereas fast-living species increased in population size. The magnitude of short-term variation in population size increased with asymptotic population growth, being buffered in slow-growing species (i.e., species with a low population growth rate) but large in fast-growing species. By demonstrating direct links between transient dynamics, life history (generation time), and ecology (demographic regime), our comparative analysis of transient dynamics clearly improves our understanding of population dynamics in variable environments and has clear implications for future studies of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. As most populations in the wild are not at equilibrium, we recommend that analyses of transient dynamics be performed when studying population dynamics in variable environments.},

abstract = {Top-predators can play important roles in terrestrial food webs, fuelling speculation that top-predators might be used as biocontrol tools against invasive mesopredators. Feral cats are believed to be largely responsible for the current declines of native fauna across tropical northern Australia, where substantial beef cattle production occurs. Dingoes are known to impact cattle production there and are predicted to impact native fauna also. However, dingoes are forecasted to curtail the impacts of cats and reverse native fauna declines. We review (1) empirical studies investigating the relationships between dingoes and cats, and dingo control and cats, (2) records of cat remains in dingo diets, and (3) historical records of lethal dingo control using 1080-poisoned baits across Australia between 1999 and 2008 to show how two naturalised invasive species can interact in dynamic agro-ecological landscapes. From the 35 studies assessed, most reported no detectable relationship between dingoes and cats; negative or positive relationships were seldom detected. Dingoes do not appear to exclude cats beyond fine scales, but may alter cat activity periods under certain conditions. Cat remains were found in only 0.63{\%} of over 31,000 dingo diet records. Lethal dingo control occurs (in varying degrees) across about two-thirds of Australia and does not appear to substantially influence dingo-cat relationships. We conclude that the presently available data provides little evidence that bolstering dingo populations will reduce the impacts of cats. Much more work is needed to identify situations where top-predators might be used as effective biocontrol tools against invasive mesopredators in agro-ecological systems.},

By manipulating the density of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, while keeping the sex ratio constant, I found that male mating tactics were phenotypically plastic with respect to density. As density increased, males decreased their courtship displays. Male-male competition and mate searching were highest at intermediate densities. Population density had no significant effect on the total number of copulations, copulatory tactics or the percentage of postcopulatory guarding. Female preference for males with a higher percentage of orange coloration was similar at all density levels. The 'opportunity for sexual selection', which estimates the upper limit to which a selected trait can shift if directional selection is operating and was calculated as the variance in number of copulations per male divided by the square of the mean number of copulations, was negatively associated with population density. This may be due to the decrease in male-male competition at high density rather than female preference which was similar across density treatments.

Although behavioural strategies in marine mammals and seabirds have been investigated in detail, little is known about the deepest-diving reptile – the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Here, we deployed tri-axial accelerometers on female leatherbacks nesting on St Croix, US Virgin Islands, to explore their diving strategy. Our results show a consistent behavioural pattern within dives among individuals, with an initial period of active swimming at relatively steep descent angles (∼–40 deg), with a stroke frequency of 0.32 Hz, followed by a gliding phase. The depth at which the gliding phase began increased with the maximum depth of the dives. In addition, descent body angles and vertical velocities were higher during deeper dives. Leatherbacks might thus regulate their inspired air-volume according to the intended dive depth, similar to hard-shelled turtles and penguins. During the ascent, turtles actively swam with a stroke frequency of 0.30 Hz but with a low vertical velocity (∼0.40 ms–1) and a low pitch angle (∼+26 deg). Turtles might avoid succumbing to decompression sickness (‘the bends') by ascending slowly to the surface. In addition, we suggest that the low body temperature of this marine ectotherm compared with that of endotherms might help reduce the risk of bubble formation by increasing the solubility of nitrogen in the blood.

abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring programs need to be designed so that population changes can be detected reliably. This can be problematical for species that are cryptic and have imperfect detection. We used occupancy modeling and power analysis to optimize the survey design for reptile monitoring programs in the UK. Surveys were carried out six times a year in 2009-2010 at multiple sites. Four out of the six species - grass snake, adder, common lizard, slow-worm -were encountered during every survey from March-September. The exceptions were the two rarest species - sand lizard and smooth snake - which were not encountered in July 2009 and March 2010 respectively. The most frequently encountered and most easily detected species was the slow-worm. For the four widespread reptile species in the UK, three to four survey visits that used a combination of directed transect walks and artificial cover objects resulted in 95{\%} certainty that a species would be detected if present. Using artificial cover objects was an effective detection method for most species, considerably increased the detection rate of some, and reduced misidentifications. To achieve an 85{\%} power to detect a decline in any of the four widespread species when the true decline is 15{\%}, three surveys at a total of 886 sampling sites, or four surveys at a total of 688 sites would be required. The sampling effort needed reduces to 212 sites surveyed three times, or 167 sites surveyed four times, if the target is to detect a true decline of 30{\%} with the same power. The results obtained can be used to refine reptile survey protocols in the UK and elsewhere. On a wider scale, the occupancy study design approach can be used to optimize survey effort and help set targets for conservation outcomes for regional or national biodiversity assessments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sewell et al.},

abstract = {The Ka'apor capuchin, Cebus kaapori, is perhaps the most endangered primate of the Brazilian Amazon. Endemic to a region with extreme intensification of habitat-degrading activities, it survives in remnant populations in a completely fragmented landscape. Before now, the only data available were isolated observations of feeding, locality records, and information on population densities and group size obtained during census. Here we present the first data on the activity budget, diet, and daily path length of the species, and compare our preliminary results with those for other capuchin monkeys. A group of nine Ka'apor capuchins was monitored over a period of four months during the dry season in the Goian{\'{e}}sia do Par{\'{a}} municipality, Par{\'{a}}, Brazil. We used instantaneous scan sampling (n = 4,647 scans) to construct an activity budget for the monkeys, and we identified the plants in their diet to species level (n = 41 plant taxa), allowing us to compare dietary overlap with other gracile capuchin species, as well as with the robust capuchin (Sapajus spp.), a potential competitor present throughout the range of the Ka'apor capuchin. Like other species of gracile capuchins, C. kaapori was highly frugivorous, with the vast majority of the feeding records of arils and fruit pulp (74{\%}), supplemented by arthropods (13{\%}) and seeds (10{\%}), although diet composition was highly variable across months. The group used a total area of 62.4 ha during the study period, and average daily path length was 2,173 m (±400 m), with the entire home range utilized in every month of the study. We found significant overlap in the diet of the Ka'apor capuchin and Sapajus, highlighting the urgency to increase knowledge of the ecological needs of C. kaapori and understand synergistic effects of sympatry with competitive species, increasing forest fragmentation, and widespread human impact on C. kaapori sustainability.

abstract = {An understanding of how top mammalian carnivores respond to urbanization is important for conservation and management of human–wildlife conflicts. Coyotes (Canis latrans) have recently become more prevalent in many metropolitan areas; however, their apparent success is poorly understood. We estimated home-range size and selection of land-use types for coyotes in a heavily urbanized landscape, with a particular focus on responses of coyotes to those parts of the urban landscape with high levels of human development or activity. Mean (6 SE) annual home ranges of transient coyotes (X¯ 5 26.80 6 2.95 km2) were larger than those of resident coyotes (X¯ 5 4.95 6 0.34 km2), and home-range size for resident coyotes did not vary among seasons or between age and sex classes. Although most home ranges were associated with natural patches of habitat, there was considerable variation among coyotes, with some home ranges entirely lacking patches of natural habitat. Within home ranges, coyotes typically avoided land-use types associated with human activity (i.e., Residential, Urban Grass, and Urban Land) regardless of coyote characteristics, seasons, and activity periods. Few coyotes were nuisances, and conflicts occurred when coyotes were sick or exposed to wildlife feeding by humans. We found little evidence that coyotes were attracted to areas associated with human activity, despite at times having home ranges located in heavily developed areas.},

The researchers studying temperament in dogs come from varied backgrounds, bringing with them diverse perspectives, and publishing in a broad range of journals. This paper reviews and evaluates the disparate work on canine temperament. We begin by summarizing general trends in research on canine temperament. To identify specific patterns, we propose several frameworks for organizing the literature based on the methods of assessment, the breeds examined, the purpose of the studies, the age at which the dogs were tested, the breeding and rearing environment, and the sexual status of the dogs. Next, an expert-sorting study shows that the enormous number of temperament traits examined can be usefully classified into seven broad dimensions. Meta-analyses of the findings pertaining to inter-rater agreement, test–retest reliability, internal consistency, and convergent validity generally support the reliability and validity of canine temperament tests but more studies are needed to support these preliminary findings. Studies examining discriminant validity are needed, as preliminary findings on discriminant validity are mixed. We close by drawing 18 conclusions about the field, identifying the major theoretical and empirical questions that remain to be addressed.},

abstract = {Determining where, when and how much animals eat is fundamental to understanding their ecology. We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either 'prey handling' or 'swimming'. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95±0.26{\%} (mean ± s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82±0.24{\%} when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09{\%}. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more 'wiggles' and 'dashes' (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean (±s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6±66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales.},

abstract = {Abstract The daily activities of animals are influenced by various factors, including their physiological adaptations and preferred habitat distributions, as well as prey availability and human disturbances. For felids, the main drivers of activity patterns appear to be prey availability and anthropogenic disturbances, as suggested by previous studies. In this study, we explore a set of variables that influence the activity patterns of Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) in Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces in north‐east China near south‐western Primorsky Krai, Russia. This area is currently the only occupied tiger habitat in China. Prey availability (e.g. wild boar, sika deer and roe deer), human disturbances (e.g. human activity, distance to human settlements and intense forest livestock grazing), and habitat structure were analysed. Our results revealed crepuscular and nocturnal activity of Amur tigers. Although the temporal overlaps between the tigers and their prey species were high, the spatial overlap indices were low. Although the presence of tigers decreased near human settlements, tigers showed a preference for walking along roads. Tigers also avoided high‐elevation coniferous and mixed hardwood forests. Overall, our results indicated that (1) tigers spatially and temporally avoided human disturbances and tigers respond behaviourally to human disturbances and (2) human disturbances may determine the activity of Amur tigers in north‐east China. In the future, to address conflicts between tigers and local humans and to improve tiger conservation, conservation planning should incorporate the spatio‐temporal activity patterns of tigers and humans.},

abstract = {Home range, habitat use, activity and movement patterns were studied in a pack of wolves in a mountainous region of Abruzzo, central Italy from June 1986 to March 1987. The home range, estimated by the minimum convex polygon from 421 radio locations, measured 197 km(2) and comprised several infrastructures and areas of human presence, including four garbage dumps and two offal sites. Core areas, calculated by the harmonic mean method, were located toward the centre of the home range where human disturbance and road density were lowest but forest cover was highest. During the time-span of the study, home-range use and movement patterns suggested a marked centrality in spatial behaviour and traditionality in retreat areas year-round, both during pup-rearing season and the following months. In addition, by being essentially nocturnal, resident wolves appeared to adopt tactics of temporal segregation from people to exploit food resources safely in the proximity of human settlements. Overall activity correlated with distance travelled (r = 0.90, P much less than 0.001), and corresponded to cyclic nocturnal movements from retreat to feeding areas. wolf movement rate between 20:00 and 04:00 h averaged 2.5 km/h but varied up to about 8 km/h, and daily distance travelled ((x) over bar = 27 km/night; range 17-38 km/night) mostly depended on the location of traditional feeding sites. Home-range configuration, habitat use, activity and movements all appeared highly integrated so as to represent the most functional compromise between avoidance of human inteference and exploitation of the available food resources.},

Hence, the siting of nests is unlikely to be the consequence of a requirement by hatchlings for freshwa-ter.

abstract = {Insects are increasingly being recognized not only as a source of food to feed the ever growing world population but also as potential sources of new products and therapeutic agents, among which are sterols. In this study, we sought to profile sterols and their derivatives present in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, focusing on those with potential importance as dietary and therapeutic components for humans. Using coupled gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we analyzed and compared the quantities of sterols in the different sections of the gut and tissues of the locust. In the gut, we identified 34 sterols which showed a patchy distribution, but with the highest composition in the foregut (55{\%}) followed by midgut (31{\%}) and hindgut (14{\%}). Fed ad libitum on wheat seedlings, five sterols unique to the insect were detected. These sterols were identified as 7-dehydrocholesterol, desmosterol, fucosterol, (3$\beta$, 5$\alpha$) cholesta-8, 14, 24-trien-3-ol, 4, 4-dimethyl, and (3$\beta$, 20R) cholesta-5, 24-dien-3, 20-diol with the first three having known health benefits in humans. Incubation of the fore-, mid- and hindgut with cholesterol-[4-13C] yielded eight derivatives, three of these were detected in the gut of the desert locust after it had consumed the vegetative diet but were not detected in the diet. Our study shows that the desert locust ingests phytosterols from a vegetative diet and, amplifies and metabolizes them into derivatives with potential salutary benefits and we discuss our findings in this context.},

abstract = {Australian dingoes haverecently been suggested as a tool to aid biodiversity conservation through the reversal or prevention of trophic cascades and mesopredator release. However, at least seven ecological and sociological considerations must be addressed before dog populations are positively managed. 1. Domestication and feralisation of dingoes have resulted in behavioural changes that continue to expose a broad range of native and introduced fauna to predation. 2. Dingoes and other dogs are classic mesopredators, while humans are the apex predator and primary ecosystem engineers in Australia. 3. Anthropogenic landscape changes could prevent modern dingoes from fulfilling their pre-European roles. 4. Dingoes areknownto exploitmanyof the same species they are often presumed to ‘protect', predisposing them to present direct risks to many threatened species. 5. The assertion that contemporary dog control facilitates the release of mesopredators disregards the realities of effective dog control, which simultaneously reduces fox and dog abundance and is unlikely to enable increases in fox abundance. 6. The processes affecting threatened fauna are likely a combination of both top-down and bottom-up effects, which will not be solved or reversed by concentrating efforts on managing only predator effects. 7. Mostimportantly,humansocial andeconomic niches are highly variable across the ecosystems where dingoes are present or proposed. Human perceptions will ultimately determine acceptance of positive dingo management. Outside of an adaptive management framework, positively managing dingoes while ignoring these seven considerations is unlikely to succeed in conserving native faunal biodiversity but is likely to have negative effects on ecological, social and economic values.},

abstract = {Background: Enumerating dog populations is essential to plan and evaluate rabies vaccination campaigns. To estimate vaccination coverage and dog population size in a Haitian commune, 15 sight-resight counts were conducted over two days following a government-sponsored vaccination campaign. Methods: Dogs received temporary laminated collars and livestock wax marks on the head and sides at the time of rabies vaccination. After the vaccination campaign, pairs of surveyors walked pre-defined routes through targeted neighborhoods, photographing and recording characteristics and location of each dog seen on a standardized data sheet. On the second survey day, surveyors retraced the prior day's track, followed the same procedure, and indicated in addition whether they believed the dogs were resighted from the prior day. After completion of the field survey, two independent evaluators reviewed photographs and characteristics of each dog to assess which had vaccination marks and which were resighted. Surveyor and photo-reviewer sight-resight decisions were compared using Cohen's kappa, and population estimates were compared using Lincoln-Petersen 95{\%} confidence intervals. Results: Field-surveyors identified dogs consistent with the photograph evaluations in 629 out of 800 instances (78.6{\%}, Cohen's kappa of 0.12). Despite this inconsistency, the population estimates resulting from the field and final determinations were not significantly different at 1,789 (95{\%} CI 1,677 to 1,901) and 1,978 (95{\%} CI 1,839 to 2,118). Vaccination coverage was also the same at 55{\%} and 56{\%}; however, an observed vaccination mark loss of 13.8{\%} suggests that the true coverage may have been closer to 64{\%}. Conclusion: Using photos improved dog identification during the sight-resight study, leading to a higher population estimate. Despite using a 2-mark system to temporarily identify vaccinated dogs, a significant proportion had lost all identifying marks by the second day of field surveys. Efforts to estimate vaccination coverage using sight-resight surveys should consider improvement of marking techniques or better accounting for potential loss of marks in their free-roaming dog vaccination coverage assessments.},

abstract = {Mixed-species associations generally form to increase foraging success or to aid in the detection and deterrence of predators. While mixed-species associations are common among mammals, those involving carnivorous predators and potential prey species are seldom reported. On the Guassa Plateau, in the Ethiopian highlands, we observed solitary Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) foraging for rodents among grazing gelada monkey (Theropithecus gelada) herds. The tolerant and sometimes prolonged ({\&}gt; 1h) associations contrasted with the defensive behaviors exhibited by geladas toward other potential predators. Ethiopian wolves spent a higher proportion of time foraging and preyed more successfully on rodents when among geladas than when alone, providing evidence that gelada herds increase the vulnerability of subterranean rodents to predation. Ethiopian wolves appear to habituate gelada herds to their presence through nonthreatening behavior, thereby foregoing opportunistic foraging opportunities upon vulnerable juvenile geladas in order to feed more effectively on rodents. For Ethiopian wolves, establishing proximity to geladas as foraging commensals could be an adaptive strategy to elevate foraging success. The novel dynamics documented here shed light on the ecological circumstances that contribute to the stability of mixed groups of predators and potential prey.Key words:},

This strong male-biased perspective has resulted in the relative neglect of variation in??female mate preferences and its consequences for ornament evolution. As sexual selection is a co-evolutionary process between males and females, ignoring variation in females overlooks a key aspect of this process. Here, we review the empirical evidence that female mate preferences, like male ornaments, are condition dependent. We show accumulating support for the hypothesis that high quality females show the strongest mate preference. Nonetheless, this is still an infant field, and we highlight areas in need of more research, both theoretical and empirical. We also examine some of the wider implications of condition-dependent mating decisions and their effect on the strength of sexual selection. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We used area- under-the-curve to explore the fit of 8 estimators of home range to data collected with both GPS and concurrent very high frequency (VHF) technology on a terrestrial mammal, the Florida panther Puma concolor coryi, to evaluate recently developed and traditional estimators. Results: Area-under-the-curve was the highest for Florida panthers equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology compared to VHF technology. For our study animal, estimators of home range that incorporated a temporal component to estimation performed better than traditional first- and second-generation estimators. Conclusions: Comparisons of fit of home range contours with locations collected would suggest that use of VHF technology is not as accurate as GPS technology to estimate size of home range for large mammals. Estimators of home range collected with GPS technology performed better than those estimated with VHF technology regardless of estimator used. Furthermore, estimators that incorporate a temporal component (third-generation estimators) appeared to be the most reliable regardless of whether kernel-based or Brownian bridge-based algorithms were used and in comparison to first- and second-generation estimators. We defined third-generation estimators of home range as any estimator that incorporates time, space, animal-specific parameters, and habitat. Such estimators would include movement-based kernel density, Brownian bridge movement models, and dynamic Brownian bridge movement models among others that have yet to be evaluated. Keywords:},

abstract = {The effect of an open landfill and the seasonality of a tropical deciduous forest in Jalisco, Mexico, was tested on the home range and group size of coyotes Canis latrans under the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH), which proposes that in social carnivores dispersion of patches of limited resources determines home-range size, whereas independently, abundance of resources affects group size. The predictions in this study were that coyotes using the landfill, where food is available all year due to the continuous arrival of food wastes that are concentrated in a single patch, would have smaller, seasonally constant home ranges than coyotes living outside, where food is distributed in several patches. In this area, coyotes would increase their home ranges during the dry season due to seasonal changes in resource availability. Also, a larger coyote group size should exist in the landfill, where food abundance is greater. Home-range size and group size of coyotes living in and outside the landfill were estimated by radio-tracking. Home ranges of coyotes in the landfill varied from 0.9 to 9.5 km2, whereas home-range sizes of coyotes outside the landfill varied from 10.9 to 43.7 km2. Seasonality had no effect on the home-range sizes. We identified a group of four adult coyotes in the landfill and no group formation in coyotes outside. These results support the predictions about home-range and group size of coyotes in relation to landfill presence, and indicate that under the circumstances of our study, coyotes follow the postulates proposed by the RDH.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that chronic periodontal infection may be associated with preterm births. The authors conducted a prospective study to test for this association. METHODS: A total of 1,313 pregnant women were recruited from the Perinatal Emphasis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Complete periodontal, medical and behavioral assessments were made between 21 and 24 weeks gestation. After delivery, medical records were consulted to determine each infant's gestational age at birth. From these data, the authors calculated relationships between periodontal disease and preterm birth, while adjusting for smoking, parity (the state or fact of having born offspring), race and maternal age. Results were expressed as odds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals, or CIs. RESULTS: Patients with severe or generalized periodontal disease had adjusted odds ratios (95 percent CI) of 4.45 (2.16-9.18) for preterm delivery (that is, before 37 weeks gestational age). The adjusted odds ratio increased with increasing prematurity to 5.28 (2.05-13.60) before 35 weeks' gestational age and to 7.07 (1.70-27.4) before 32 weeks' gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' data show an association between the presence of periodontitis at 21 to 24 weeks' gestation and subsequent preterm birth. Further studies are needed to determine whether periodontitis is the cause. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: While this large prospective study has shown a significant association between preterm birth and periodontitis at 21 to 24 weeks' gestation, neither it nor other studies to date were designed to determine whether treatment of periodontitis will reduce the risk of preterm birth. Pending an answer to this important question, it remains appropriate to advise expectant mothers about the importance of good oral health.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The etiology of reptilian viral diseases can be attributed to a wide range of viruses occurring across different genera and families. Thirty to forty years ago, studies of viruses in reptiles focused mainly on the zoonotic potential of arboviruses in reptiles and much effort went into surveys and challenge trials of a range of reptiles with eastern and western equine encephalitis as well as Japanese encephalitis viruses. In the past decade, outbreaks of infection with West Nile virus in human populations and in farmed alligators in the USA has seen the research emphasis placed on the issue of reptiles, particularly crocodiles and alligators, being susceptible to, and reservoirs for, this serious zoonotic disease. Although there are many recognised reptilian viruses, the evidence for those being primary pathogens is relatively limited. Transmission studies establishing pathogenicity and cofactors are likewise scarce, possibly due to the relatively low commercial importance of reptiles, difficulties with the availability of animals and permits for statistically sound experiments, difficulties with housing of reptiles in an experimental setting or the inability to propagate some viruses in cell culture to sufficient titres for transmission studies. Viruses as causes of direct loss of threatened species, such as the chelonid fibropapilloma associated herpesvirus and ranaviruses in farmed and wild tortoises and turtles, have re-focused attention back to the characterisation of the viruses as well as diagnosis and pathogenesis in the host itself.1.

Through direct observation, we recorded the location of coyote scent marks and information regarding the identity of the marking animal. Patterns of scent-marking were then analyzed spatially and demographically. All of the evidence from the present study supports a strong relationship between scent-marking and territoriality in these coyotes, and all predictions were met. A preponderance of scent marks was found in the periphery of territories. Most of those marks were raised-leg urinations (RLUs) and forward-lean urinations (FLUs), postures associated very strongly with males, particularly dominant individuals. Ground-scratching was also closely associated with these types of marks and was performed more on the periphery of territories than in the interior. A complete lack of overlap of adjacent territories and very limited overlap of movements into territories fits classic definitions of territory and home range. Scent-marking seems to be strongly associated with the establishment and maintenance of these boundaries between packs of coyotes competing for the same resources in a limited space.},

abstract = {Introduced into Australia in 1935, the cane toad (Chaunus [Bufo] marinus) threatens native vertebrate predators. However, there have been few rigorous quantitative studies on species threatened by this toxic invasive species. This study examines the changes in abundance and proportion of sites occupied by Merten{\^{a}}€™s water monitor (Varanus mertensi) at a site in the Northern Territory following invasion by cane toads. The study was located at Manton Dam Recreation Area, 70 km south of Darwin, and ran for 18 months. Cane toads were first detected at the study site in February 2005, three months after the first survey, and their abundance remained low until February 2006, when an increase was observed. The abundance of V. mertensi declined substantially 8 months after the arrival of cane toads and remained low. The probability of detection of V. mertensi varied considerably within and among surveys, and was higher in the wet season surveys. The proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi at the start of the study was 0.95 {\^{A}}± 0.03. Site occupancy remained high for 6 months after the arrival of cane toads, but declined gradually to a low of 0.15 {\^{A}}± 0.16 within 12 months. There has been demonstrable change in the abundance and proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi following the colonisation of cane toads, but the population has been able to persist. Monitoring of populations impacted by cane toads may provide unique opportunities to understand processes underlying local extinction and colonisation of native predators following the impact of invasive species.},

abstract = {There is considerable evidence that primates housed under impoverished conditions develop behavioural abnormalities, including, in the most extreme example, self-harming behaviour. This has implications for all contexts in which primates are maintained in captivity from laboratories to zoos since by compromising the animals' psychological well-being and allowing them to develop behavioural abnormalities their value as appropriate educational and research models is diminished. This review examines the extensive body of literature documenting attempts to improve living conditions with a view to correcting behavioural abnormalities and housing primates in such a way that they are encouraged to exhibit a more natural range and proportion of behaviours, including less self-directed and social aggression. The results of housing, feeding, physical, sensory and social enrichment efforts are examined with specific focus on their effect on aggressive behaviour and variation in their use and efficacy. It is concluded that while inappropriate or poorly distributed enrichment may encourage aggressive competition, enrichment that is species, sex, age and background appropriate can dramatically reduce aggression, can eliminate abnormal behaviour and substantially improve the welfare of primates maintained in captivity.},

abstract = {Compassionate conservation focuses on 4 tenets: first, do no harm; individuals matter; inclusivity of individual animals; and peaceful coexistence between humans and animals. Recently, compassionate conservation has been promoted as an alternative to conventional conservation philosophy. We believe examples presented by compassionate conservationists are deliberately or arbitrarily chosen to focus on mammals; inherently not compassionate; and offer ineffective conservation solutions. Compassionate conservation arbitrarily focuses on charismatic species, notably large predators and megaherbivores. The philosophy is not compassionate when it leaves invasive predators in the environment to cause harm to vastly more individuals of native species or uses the fear of harm by apex predators to terrorize mesopredators. Hindering the control of exotic species (megafauna, predators) in situ will not improve the conservation condition of the majority of biodiversity. The positions taken by so-called compassionate conservationists on particular species and on conservation actions could be extended to hinder other forms of conservation, including translocations, conservation fencing, and fertility control. Animal welfare is incredibly important to conservation, but ironically compassionate conservation does not offer the best welfare outcomes to animals and is often ineffective in achieving conservation goals. Consequently, compassionate conservation may threaten public and governmental support for conservation because of the limited understanding of conservation problems by the general public.},

abstract = {For many animal species that are difficult to access, the behaviour of free-ranging individuals cannot be assessed by direct observation. In order to remedy this, we developed a new technique using a motion detector (acceleration data-logger) for monitoring the activity and behaviour of free-ranging vertebrates and tested its efficiency on a domestic cat, Felis catus. A total of 3615 min of surging acceleration was measured along the longitudinal body axis of an adult male cat. The cat's behaviour was also filmed for 113 min, these video data being used to correlate the logger's signals with the cat's behaviour. Acceleration data-loggers attached on the cat's collar recorded acceleration signals which were influenced by both the gravitational acceleration resulting from the body posture and the dynamic acceleration resulting from the dynamic behaviour of the cat. By applying spectral analysis based on a fast Fourier Transform to acceleration signals, body postures and some of the dynamic behaviours of the cat such as drinking, eating, and several paces of travelling were efficiently determined. The present study shows that acceleration data-loggers represent a useful and reliable system for accurately recording the activities and detail behaviours of the terrestrial animals. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An ethogram is a catalogue of discrete behaviors typically employed by a species. Traditionally animal behavior has been recorded by observing study individuals directly. However, this approach is difficult, often impossible, in the case of behaviors which occur in remote areas and/or at great depth or altitude. The recent development of increasingly sophisticated, animal-borne data loggers, has started to overcome this problem. Accelerometers are particularly useful in this respect because they can record the dynamic motion of a body in e.g. flight, walking, or swimming. However, classifying behavior using body acceleration characteristics typically requires prior knowledge of the behavior of free-ranging animals. Here, we demonstrate an automated procedure to categorize behavior from body acceleration, together with the release of a user-friendly computer application, "Ethographer". We evaluated its performance using longitudinal acceleration data collected from a foot-propelled diving seabird, the European shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis. The time series data were converted into a spectrum by continuous wavelet transformation. Then, each second of the spectrum was categorized into one of 20 behavior groups by unsupervised cluster analysis, using k-means methods. The typical behaviors extracted were characterized by the periodicities of body acceleration. Each categorized behavior was assumed to correspond to when the bird was on land, in flight, on the sea surface, diving and so on. The behaviors classified by the procedures accorded well with those independently defined from depth profiles. Because our approach is performed by unsupervised computation of the data, it has the potential to detect previously unknown types of behavior and unknown sequences of some behaviors.},

We collected information from papers on the interaction of dogs and wildlife species as well as from interviews with National Park managers. Studies in protected areas in Brazil listed 37 native species affected by the presence of dogs due to competition, predation, or pathogen transmission. Among the 69 threatened species of the Brazilian fauna, 55{\%} have been cited in studies on dogs. Dog occurrence was assessed for 31 National Parks in Brazil. The presence of human residents and hunters in protected areas were the factors most often quoted as facilitating dog occurrence. These may be feral, street or domestically owned dogs found in protected areas in urban, rural or natural areas. Effective actions to control this invasive alien species in natural areas must consider dog dependence upon humans, pathways of entry, and the surrounding landscape and context.},

abstract = {Accelerometers are motion-detection devices that, when attached to animals, are capable of detecting body orientation, overall activity levels, and specific behavior patterns. We deployed accelerometers in order to study the hypothesis that accelerometer output would allow us to distinguish between 4 behavior patterns in 3 adult female African elephants Loxodonta africana at Disney's Animal Kingdom{\textregistered}, Florida, USA. Tri-axial accelerometer data loggers were attached to the tops of collars worn around the elephants' necks. Behavior was documented on video while the accelerometer output was stored on the data logger. Feeding, bathing, and walking behaviors were recorded in all 3 subjects, while swaying behavior could be recorded in only 1 subject. Data in the 3 physical dimensions (sway, surge, and heave) were analyzed in terms of overall magnitude of movement (dynamic acceleration) and in terms of the periodicity of movement. When classifying accelerometer data of unlabeled origin to the correct behavioral state, overall success ranged from 70 to 91{\%}. Bathing was sometimes confused with feeding and walking, but feeding, walking, and swaying were easily distinguished from each other. These results show that data from accelerometers can distinguish an elephant's behavioral states, and thus may be used to monitor elephant behavior remotely. Such devices could be deployed for a variety of purposes, ranging from monitoring elephant activity in zoos to an early-warning system that could alert the authorities when wild elephants are being illegally hunted. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {For the vast majority of cases, it is highly unlikely that all the individuals of a population will be encountered during a study. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a constant fraction of the population is encountered over times, locations, or species to be compared. Hence, simple counts usually will not be good indices of population size. We recommend that detection probabilities (the probability of including an individual in a count) be estimated and incorporated into inference procedures. However, most techniques for estimating detection probability require moderate sample sizes, which may not be achievable when studying rare species. In order to improve the reliability of inferences from studies of rare species, we suggest two general approaches that researchers may wish to consider that incorporate the concept of imperfect detectability: (1) borrowing information about detectability or the other quantities of interest from other times, places, or species; and (2) using state variables other than abundance (e.g., species richness and occupancy). We illustrate these suggestions with examples and discuss the relative benefits and drawbacks of each approach.},

The tissues of two individual civets that died tested PCR-positive for parvovirus infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed this parvovirus strain falls in a basal position to a clade of CPV that have infected dogs in China and Uruguay, suggesting cross-species transmission from domestic to wild animals. Our analysis further identified these viruses as genotype CPV-2a that is enzootic in carnivores. The ubiquity of virus infection in multiple tissues suggests this virus is pathogenic to civet cats. Here we document the cross-species transmission from domestic dogs and cats to wild civet populations, highlighting the vulnerability of wildlife to infectious agents in companion animals.},

abstract = {There are few quantitative examinations of the extent to which dogs discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar persons. In our study we have investigated whether dogs show differential behaviour towards humans of different degrees of familiarity (owner, familiar person, unfamiliar person). Dogs and humans were observed in eight test situations: (1) Three-way strange situation test, (2) Calling in from food, (3) Obedience test, (4) Walking away, (5) Threatening approach, (6) Playful interaction, (7) Food inhibition test and (8) Manipulation of the dog's body. Dogs distinguished between the owner and the two other test partners in those tests which involved separation from the owner (Test 1, 4), were aversive for the dog (Test 5) or involved playing interaction (Test 6). Our results revealed that the owner cannot be replaced by a familiar person in situations provoking elevated anxiety and fear. In contrasts, dogs did not discriminate between the owner and the familiar person in those tests that were based on obedient behaviour or behaviour towards an assertive person (Tests 2, 3, 7 and 8). Dogs' former training experience reduced the difference between their behaviour towards the owner and the familiar person in situations requiring obedience but it did not mask it totally. The dogs' behaviour towards each of the humans participating in the tests was consistent all over the test series. In summary, dogs discriminated between their owner and the unfamiliar person and always preferred the owner to the unfamiliar person. However, the discrimination between the owner and the familiar person is context-specific. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Canine Behavior. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The use of trap-neuter-return (TNR) as a humane alternative to the lethal management of free-roaming cats has been on the rise for several decades in the United States; however a relative paucity of data from TNR programs exists. An iconic community-wide TNR effort; initiated in 1992 and renowned for having eliminated hundreds of free-roaming cats from the Newburyport; Massachusetts waterfront; is cited repeatedly; yet few details appear in the literature. Although the presence of feline population data was quite limited; a detailed narrative emerged from an examination of contemporaneous reports; extant TNR program documents; and stakeholder testimony. Available evidence indicates that an estimated 300 free-roaming cats were essentially unmanaged prior to the commencement of the TNR program; a quick reduction of up to one-third of the cats on the waterfront was attributed to the adoption of sociable cats and kittens; the elimination of the remaining population; over a 17-year period; was ascribed to attrition. These findings illuminate the potential effectiveness of TNR as a management practice; as well as call attention to the need for broad adoption of systematic data collection and assessment protocols.},

Detailed autopsies were performed on 17 of the dead kangaroos: primary predation was the only significant gross pathological finding; the dingoes had eaten portions from about half the kangaroos killed. The daily rate of killing was estimated to be about 0.38 kg prey per kg predator. The rate of killing and the selection for juvenile kangaroos suggested that dingoes could have a direct effect on kangaroo densities by limiting rate of increase. The significance of this finding is discussed with reference to the difference in abundance of kangaroos between the New South Wales and Queensland sides of the border fence.},

Although the methods are very easy to use, their usefulness relies heavily on certain assumptions that are generally unrealistic.

The activities of water monitor were more frequently seen from 0900 – 1200 hrs and from 1530 – 1700 hrs of the day. Proportion of time spent on diﬀerent behavioral states by the water monitors were varied significantly in both wet and dry season. It was found that adult water monitor spent highest proportion of time in foraging activity during rainy or wet season and during winter or in dry season they spent maximum time in resting or basking. Most preferred diet of V. salvator during this study was crabs and besides these they showed their character as scavenger also. As the study species was poikilothermic animal so, the influences of environmental variables upon their activities in different habitats either in summer or in winter might not be ignored.},

@article{Holt1997,
abstract = {Many important issues in community ecology revolve around the interplay of competition and predation. Species that compete may also be locked in predator-prey interactions, a mixture of competition and predation known as "intraguild predation" (IGP). There is growing evidence for the importance of IGP in many natural communities, yet little formal ecological theory addresses this particular blend of interactions. In this article, we explore the consequences of incorporating IGP into standard models of exploitative competition and food chains (a general resource-consumer model, a Lotka-Volterra food chain model, and Schoener's exploitative competition model). Our theoretical analyses suggest a general criterion for coexistence in IGP systems: the intermediate species (the prey in intraguild predation) should be superior at exploitative competition for the shared resource, whereas the top species (the predator) should gain significantly from its consumption of the intermediate species. Along gradients in environmental productivity, coexistence is most likely at intermediate levels of productivity. Analyses of the models reveal the potential for alternative stable states in systems with IGP; these are particularly likely if the top predator gains little benefit from consuming the intermediate predator. We further show that IGP can lead to unstable population dynamics, even when all pairwise interactions are inherently stable and each species can increase when rare. Persistent, strong IGP raises a puzzle of species coexistence, particularly in productive environments. We conclude by comparing IGP with related community modules (i.e., food chains, exploitative competition, apparent competition) and discussing mechanisms that should foster coexistence in systems with strong IGP.},

abstract = {Background: Foraging efficiency determines whether animals will be able to raise healthy broods, maintain their own condition, avoid predators and ultimately increase their fitness. Using accelerometers and GPS loggers, features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable conditions can be translated into energetic costs of movement, which, in turn, can be translated to energy landscapes.We investigated energy landscapes in Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua from two colonies at New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Results: In our study, the marine areas used by the penguins, parameters of dive depth and the proportion of pelagic and benthic dives varied both between years and colonies. As a consequence, the energy landscapes also varied between the years, and we discuss how this was related to differences in food availability, which were also reflected in differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and isotopic niche metrics. In the second year, the energy landscape was characterized by lower foraging costs per energy gain, and breeding success was also higher in this year. Additionally, an area around three South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis colonies was never used. Conclusions: These results confirm that energy landscapes vary in time and that the seabirds forage in areas of the energy landscapes that result in minimized energetic costs. Thus, our results support the view of energy landscapes and fear of predation as mechanisms underlying animal foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we show that energy landscapes are useful in linking energy gain and variable energy costs of foraging to breeding success.},

Data were collected prospectively; 394 women (93.1{\%}) were followed by telephone interview up to the first few weeks after the expected date of delivery, using standardized procedures. The presence of major structural malformations, excluding chromosomal and genetic diseases, was evaluated in 311 infants exposed to a median daily dose of vitamin A of 50,000 IU per day (range, 10,000-300,000 IU per day; interquartile range, 25,000-60,000 IU per day). Three infants with a major malformation were reported: pulmonary stenosis, stenotic anus with fistula, and bilateral inguinal hernia. No congenital malformations were reported among 120 infants exposed to more than 50,000 IU per day of vitamin A. When the birth prevalence rate of major malformations in the study group was compared with two internal control groups of infants exposed to: 1) "high" vitamin A exposure later in pregnancy, and 2) nonteratogenic agent exposures, the rate ratio was, respectively, 0.28 (CI 95{\%} interval, 0.06, 1.23) and 0.50 (CI 95{\%} interval, 0.14, 1.76). The studied sample did not provide evidence for an increased risk of major malformations, associated with "high" vitamin A intake during the organogenetic period, higher than 2.76 above the control reference risk of 1.91{\%} (power 80{\%}, alpha 0.10).},

abstract = {Resource selection functions (RSF) are often developed using satellite (ARGOS) or Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry datasets, which provide a large amount of highly correlated data. We discuss and compare the use of generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) and generalized estimating equations (GEE) for using this type of data to develop RSFs. GLMMs directly model differences among caribou, while GEEs depend on an adjustment of the standard error to compensate for correlation of data points within individuals. Empirical standard errors, rather than model-based standard errors, must be used with either GLMMs or GEEs when developing RSFs. There are several important differences between these approaches; in particular, GLMMs are best for producing parameter estimates that predict how management might influence individuals, while GEEs are best for predicting how management might influence populations. As the interpretation, value, and statistical significance of both types of parameter estimates differ, it is important that users select the appropriate analytical method. We also outline the use of k-fold cross validation to assess fit of these models. Both GLMMs and GEEs hold promise for developing RSFs as long as they are used appropriately.},

abstract = {Coyotes (Canis latrans) are now ubiquitous throughout most of the eastern United States; however, little information exists on how they are able to exploit and thrive in fragmented landscapes. We investigated home ranges, movements, and scale-dependent resource selection of coyotes along a gradient (suburban/exurban/rural) of anthropogenic disturbance. Home-range sizes varied along a suburban-to-rural gradient and were inversely corre- lated to urbanization (R2 = 0.79, P {\textless}0.001). Habitat composition and coyote use of 95{\%} (home range) and 50{\%} (core area) contours were nonrandom. Coyotes used corridor habitat extensively and avoided urban and crop-field habi- tats. Forested habitat was used extensively for diurnal cover. Rural coyotes traveled greater distances at faster rates than did suburban/exurban coyotes. Diel activity patterns were similar along the gradient, suggesting that coyotes responded similarly to differing levels and types of human activity. Coyotes appeared to assess habitat quality at the landscape scale and exploited small, disjunct resource patches present in developed landscapes. We believe that the availability of foraging habitat and travel corridors is critical to movement of coyotes in areas of high human activity.},

abstract = {Introduced into Australia in 1935, the cane toad (Chaunus [Bufo] marinus) threatens native vertebrate predators. However, there have been few rigorous quantitative studies on species threatened by this toxic invasive species. This study examines the changes in abundance and proportion of sites occupied by Merten{\^{a}}€™s water monitor (Varanus mertensi) at a site in the Northern Territory following invasion by cane toads. The study was located at Manton Dam Recreation Area, 70 km south of Darwin, and ran for 18 months. Cane toads were first detected at the study site in February 2005, three months after the first survey, and their abundance remained low until February 2006, when an increase was observed. The abundance of V. mertensi declined substantially 8 months after the arrival of cane toads and remained low. The probability of detection of V. mertensi varied considerably within and among surveys, and was higher in the wet season surveys. The proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi at the start of the study was 0.95 {\^{A}}± 0.03. Site occupancy remained high for 6 months after the arrival of cane toads, but declined gradually to a low of 0.15 {\^{A}}± 0.16 within 12 months. There has been demonstrable change in the abundance and proportion of sites occupied by V. mertensi following the colonisation of cane toads, but the population has been able to persist. Monitoring of populations impacted by cane toads may provide unique opportunities to understand processes underlying local extinction and colonisation of native predators following the impact of invasive species.},

Complete blood counts, fecal corticosterone, and body weights were measured at the beginning and end of the test period. Activities performed within the two environments were also compared. Turtles in enriched enclosures had a significantly lower heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L) at the end of the treatment period (p = 0.01). Enriched-housed turtles also spent significantly less time engaged in escape behaviour (p {\textless} 0.01). There was no significant difference in fecal corticosterone or body weight change between the two treatment groups. At the beginning of the study, each turtle was placed in a preference test system in which it could move freely between a barren and enriched environment. Relative-dwelling time (RDT) was determined for each environment. Turtles showed a distinct preference for the enriched environment (90.9{\%} median RDT, p {\textless} 0.01). After the 1-month housing experiment turtles were revaluated for preference to determine if previous housing experience affected choice. Turtles continued to prefer an enriched environment regardless of prior housing conditions (97.6{\%} median RDT, p {\textless} 0.01). Results of this study demonstrate that the captive housing environment impacts the physiology and behaviour of box turtles, and suggest housing modifications that encourage typical species-specific behaviour should be provided. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study aimed at estimating the population size and attitudes of residents towards caring for domestic dogs, through questionnaire surveys, as well as the frequency of these animals in different habitats (anthropic and forest patch), using scent stations. The study was conducted in a severely fragmented area of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. A large number of unrestricted dogs was recorded, averaging 6.2 ind/km². These dogs have owners and are regularly fed. Dog records decreased from the anthropogenic matrix to the forest patch edge, which suggests that dogs act as an edge effect on forest patches. Encounters between domestic dog and wild animals can still be frequent in severely fragmented landscapes, mainly at the forest edges. However the fact that most dogs have an owner and are more frequent in the anthropic habitat suggests that their putative effects are less severe than expected for a carnivore of such abundance, but the reinforcement of responsible ownership is needed to further ameliorate such effects.},

abstract = {Most protected areas are too small to sustain populations of wide-ranging mammals; thus, identification and conservation of high-quality habitat for those animals outside parks is often a high priority, particularly for regions where extensive land conversion is occurring. This is the case in the vicinity of Emas National Park, a small protected area in the Brazilian Cerrado. Over the last 40 years the native vegetation surrounding the park has been converted to agriculture, but the region still supports virtually all of the animals native to the area. We determined the effectiveness of scat-detection dogs in detecting presence of five species of mammals threatened with extinction by habitat loss: maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), puma (Puma concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), and giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus). The probability of scat detection varied among the five species and among survey quadrats of different size, but was consistent across team, season, and year. The probability of occurrence, determined from the presence of scat, in a randomly selected site within the study area ranged from 0.14 for jaguars, which occur primarily in the forested areas of the park, to 0.91 for maned wolves, the most widely distributed species in our study area. Most occurrences of giant armadillos in the park were in open grasslands, but in the agricultural matrix they tended to occur in riparian woodlands. At least one target species occurred in every survey quadrat, and giant armadillos, jaguars, and maned wolves were more likely to be present in quadrats located inside than outside the park. The effort required for detection of scats was highest for the two felids. We were able to detect the presence for each of five wide-ranging species inside and outside the park and to assign occurrence probabilities to specific survey sites. Thus, scat dogs provide an effective survey tool for rare species even when accurate detection likelihoods are required. We believe the way we used scat-detection dogs to determine the presence of species can be applied to the detection of other mammalian species in other ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Animals that scavenge in and around human settlements need to utilise a broad range of resources, and thus generalist scavengers are likely to be better adapted to human-dominated habitats. In India, free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) live in close proximity with humans in diverse habitats, from forest fringes to metropolises, and are heavily dependent on humans for their food. It has been argued that the ability to digest carbohydrates was one of the driving forces for dog domestication. Though dogs are better adapted to digest carbohydrates than other canids, pet dogs show a clear preference for animal proteins. Our observations on streets of urban and semi-urban localities show that the free-ranging dogs are scavengers which primarily receive carbohydrate-rich food from humans. Their source for animal protein is typically garbage bins and leftovers, and such resources are rare. Using a series of field-based experiments, we test if the free-ranging dogs have adapted to a generalist scavenging lifestyle by losing preference for animal protein. Our experiments show that the free-ranging dogs, which are descendants of the decidedly carnivorous gray wolf (Canis lupus lupus), have retained a clear preference for meat, which is manifested by their choice of anything that smells of meat, irrespective of the actual nutrient content. The plasticity in their diet probably fosters efficient scavenging in a competitive environment, while a rule of thumb for preferentially acquiring specific nutrients enables them to sequester proteins from the carbohydrate-dominated environment.},

When individuals were placed into an aquarium, the number of agonistic challenges, their mean duration, and maximum intensity reached were high initially but then decreased steadily as the hierarchy developed. In all groups, linear hierarchies emerged which became increasingly stable over time. Winning influenced subsequent fighting behavior on two distinct time scales. In the short term, recent winners became progressively less likely to retreat. Second, individuals occupying dominant positions for days became increasingly likely to escalate to higher intensities early in the encounter. Both effects biased the outcome of future interactions such that winning enhanced further success and losing decreased an individual's subsequent chances for dominance.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have a near-global distribution. They range from being feral and free-ranging to owned and completely dependent on humans. All types of domestic dogs can interact with wildlife and have severe negative impacts on biodiversity. Here, we use IUCN Red List data to quantify the number of threatened species negatively impacted by dogs, assess the prevalence of different types of dog impact, and identify regional hotspots containing high numbers of impacted species. Using this information, we highlight key research and management gaps and priorities. Domestic dogs have contributed to 11 vertebrate extinctions and are a known or potential threat to at least 188 threatened species worldwide. These estimates are greater than those reported by previous assessments, but are probably conservative due to biases in the species, regions and types of impacts studied and/or reported. Predation is the most frequently reported impact, followed by disturbance, disease transmission, competition, and hybridisation. Regions with the most species impacted are: South-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Asia (excluding SE), Micro/Mela/Polynesia, and Australia. We propose that the impacts of domestic dogs can be better understood and managed through: taxonomic and spatial prioritisation of research and management; examining potential synergisms between dogs and other threatening processes; strategic engagement with animal welfare and human health campaigns; community engagement and education; and mitigating anthropogenic effects such as resource subsidies. Such actions are essential for threatened species persistence, especially given that human and dog populations are expected to increase both numerically and geographically in the coming decades.},

abstract = {Humans alter landscapes and native species distributions in many ways, including alterations mediated via domestic pets. While the negative impacts of domestic cats are well documented worldwide, the ecological effects of domestic dogs have received less scientific attention, particularly in the United States. Prevalence of free-ranging dogs may be especially problematic in areas with low density, but relatively ubiquitous human populations. We used camera-trap data collected during a 2008–2010 landscape-scale study consisting of 1181 camera stations (357 camera clusters) stratified over 16 counties in southern Illinois, USA, to estimate occupancy for domestic cats and dogs. We compared models of occupancy for three land cover types (forest, grassland, and wetland) in relation to anthropogenic features and estimated and compared the proportion of the region occupied by each species. Cats occurred across a moderate proportion of the landscape ($\psi$¯ = 0.44 ± 0.13 SE) and were associated with anthropogenic features. Moreover, we found domestic dog occupancy was greater across the landscape ($\psi$¯ = 0.59 ± 0.09), influenced more generally by land cover type, and was highest on grasslands and privately owned land. Domestic cat occupancy was more localized than that of dogs and less influenced by land cover type compared to anthropogenic features. Model averaged probability of dog occupancy was {\textgreater}0.50 across 19,049.39 km2of the region ({\textgreater}99{\%}), but only 2270.53 km2(11.8{\%}) for cats. Thus, while domestic cats may pose a more intensive threat to wildlife within the area they occupy, the impact of domestic dogs is likely to be more geographically extensive. Predicting the potential effects of these non-native species is complicated by a nuanced interaction between landscape composition, human density, and human behavior, and upends simplistic perceptions of the relative threats posed by the two species.},

abstract = {The conversion of natural habitats to croplands is a major cause of the global loss of species diversity and ecosystem services. One potentially effective method for enhancing the biodiversity of important groups such as insects, and their associated ecosystem services within croplands, is to increase the environmental complexity of the agricultural matrix. This can be achieved in perennial tree crops by planting mixed-age stands. There is, however, very little evidence for the effects of stand age on biodiversity in tropical tree crops. In this study, we assess how ground-foraging ant communities differ in relation to oil palm stand age, currently the dominant tree crop across tropical Southeast Asia. Oil palm age did not affect overall ant species richness. However, the numbers of species that were either common or numerically-dominant decreased with increases in canopy cover, which positively correlated with oil palm age, suggesting greater species evenness in older oil palm. In mature, but not young, oil palm, ant species co-occurred non-randomly, suggesting competitive exclusion and species segregation. Species responses to variables associated with oil palm age depended on their functional group. Generally, opportunists and generalized myrmicines were less abundant and less diverse, whereas specialist predators were more abundant and diverse, in older oil palm. Our results show that ground-foraging ant communities in oil palm change significantly in composition, but not in species richness, with crop age. These results suggest that mixed-age stands could support compositionally variable communities and help boost insect diversity in otherwise homogeneous perennial monocultures.},

abstract = {Skull structure is intimately associated with feeding ability in vertebrates, both in terms of specific performance measures and general ecological characteristics. This study quantitatively assessed variation in the shape of the cranium and mandible in varanoid lizards, and its relationship to structural performance (von Mises strain) and interspecific differences in feeding ecology. Geometric morphometric and linear morphometric analyses were used to evaluate morphological differences, and finite element analysis was used to quantify variation in structural performance (strain during simulated biting, shaking and pulling). This data was then integrated with ecological classes compiled from relevant scientific literature on each species in order to establish structure-function relationships. Finite element modelling results showed that variation in cranial morphology resulted in large differences in the magnitudes and locations of strain in biting, shaking and pulling load cases. Gracile species such as Varanus salvadorii displayed high strain levels during shaking, especially in the areas between the orbits. All models exhibit less strain during pull back loading compared to shake loading, even though a larger force was applied (pull =30N, shake = 20N). Relationships were identified between the morphology, performance, and ecology. Species that did not feed on hard prey clustered in the gracile region of cranial morphospace and exhibited significantly higher levels of strain during biting (P = 0.0106). Species that fed on large prey clustered in the elongate area of mandible morphospace. This relationship differs from those that have been identified in other taxonomic groups such as crocodiles and mammals. This difference may be due to a combination of the open ‘space-frame' structure of the varanoid lizard skull, and the ‘pull back' behaviour that some species use for processing large prey.},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {It is fundamentally important for many animal ecologists to quantify the costs of animal activities, although it is not straightforward to do so. The recording of triaxial acceleration by animal-attached devices has been proposed as a way forward for this, with the specific suggestion that dynamic body acceleration (DBA) be used as a proxy for movement-based power. Dynamic body acceleration has now been validated frequently, both in the laboratory and in the field, although the literature still shows that some aspects of DBA theory and practice are misunderstood. Here, we examine the theory behind DBA and employ modelling approaches to assess factors that affect the link between DBA and energy expenditure, from the deployment of the tag, through to the calibration of DBA with energy use in laboratory and field settings. Using data from a range of species and movement modes, we illustrate that vectorial and additive DBA metrics are proportional to each other. Either can be used as a proxy for energy and summed to estimate total energy expended over a given period, or divided by time to give a proxy for movement-related metabolic power. Nonetheless, we highlight how the ability of DBA to predict metabolic rate declines as the contribution of non-movement-related factors, such as heat production, increases. Overall, DBA seems to be a substantive proxy for movement-based power but consideration of other movement-related metrics, such as the static body acceleration and the rate of change of body pitch and roll, may enable researchers to refine movement-based metabolic costs, particularly in animals where movement is not characterized by marked changes in body acceleration.},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivores have adapted to successfully occupy a wide range of
environments spanning tropical to polar ecosystems. Some species,
however, have evolved in ways that constrain their ability to thrive in
extreme environmental conditions. For example many members of the Family
Mustelidae are vulnerable to extreme temperatures resulting from their
tubular body shape. The American mink (Neovison vison) likely faces
these temperature constraints, being a smaller-bodied mustelid that
ranges over a large portion of North America. Mink are largely
understudied in its native range with knowledge being particularly
sparse with respect to winter ecology. During 2011-2012 we conducted
winter telemetry on seven adult mink and used resource selection
function models to assess habitat selection patterns while considering
spatial extent and gender. We found that at a larger extent, the
animals' use of habitat was strongly linked to riparian features,
whereas this effect was less noticeable at a finer scale. The larger
males selected more lakeshore habitat, whereas the smaller females
generally were near smaller streams with both selecting for beaver
modified habitat. While we recognize the limited sample size in our
study, we speculate that this spatial separation could be linked to
higher energetic costs for females to forage aquatically in winter
because of their smaller body size. This may make females more sensitive
to competition from other forest carnivores (e.g. American marten) as
well as impacts from resource development activities.},

abstract = {Wildlife management and research programmes often rely on the capturing of live animals. All capture methods for wildlife involve a risk of injury. For that reason, monitoring of injuries should be completed concurrently, and efficiently, throughout the intervention programme, or study period, to uphold welfare standards. Here, we present a practical adaptive management system to monitor trap-related injuries as a component of broader attempts to maintain welfare standards. The monitoring system described is part of a large-scale tuberculosis-control management programme of European badgers (Meles meles) in the Republic of Ireland. Badgers were captured in stopped cable restraints. A standardised operating procedure was developed to allow for the necropsy of large numbers of badgers (N = 18,596) by a veterinary pathologist. As part of this programme, badger injury status was evaluated using a categorical severity scale ranging from 0 (no impact due to capture) to 6 (death) for badgers captured in restraints. No restraint-related deaths were recorded over the study period. Eighty-four percent of captured badgers exhibited no impact or only superficial hair/skin compression (scale 0–1). Logistic models indicated that injury severity was significantly influenced by year, season, age class, gender, weight and the body position where the badger was captured. Despite the low prevalence of severe injuries recorded, the proportion of animals with a minor injury type (skin oedema; scale 2) increased during the study period. This highlights the need for continual sensitive welfare vigilance during prolonged programmes. We suggest improvements to the current programme and additional adjustments for future vaccination campaigns. We contend that this type of monitoring, coupled with adaptive management strategies, is essential for wildlife programmes to maintain high animal welfare standards, at least in terms of injuries, but also highlight that trap injuries are only one component of animal welfare. We suggest that this adaptive management system could serve as a template for other similar wildlife programmes.},

abstract = {The existence of free-roaming dogs raises important issues in animal welfare and in public health. A proper understanding of these animals' ecology is useful as a necessary input to plan strategies to control these populations. The present study addresses the population dynamics and the effectiveness of the sterilization of unrestricted dogs using capture and recapture procedures suitable for open animal populations. Every two months, over a period of 14 months, we captured, tagged, released and recaptured dogs in two regions in a city in the southeast region of Brazil. In one of these regions the animals were also sterilized. Both regions had similar social, environmental and demographic features. We estimated the presence of 148 females and 227 males during the period of study. The average dog:man ratio was 1 dog for each 42 and 51 human beings, in the areas without and with sterilization, respectively. The animal population size increased in both regions, due mainly to the abandonment of domestic dogs. Mortality rate decreased throughout the study period. Survival probabilities did not differ between genders, but males entered the population in higher numbers. There were no differences in abundance, survival and recruitment between the regions, indicating that sterilization did not affect the population dynamics. Our findings indicate that the observed animal dynamics were influenced by density-independent factors, and that sterilization might not be a viable and effective strategy in regions where availability of resources is low and animal abandonment rates are high. Furthermore, the high demographic turnover rates observed render the canine free-roaming population younger, thus more susceptible to diseases, especially to rabies and leishmaniasis. We conclude by stressing the importance of implementing educational programs to promote responsible animal ownership and effective strategies against abandonment practices.},

abstract = {The thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was one of Australia's largest predators, but became extinct in mainland Australia soon after the arrival of a new predator, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) around 3500 BP. Evidence implicating the dingo in the thylacine's extinction has been equivocal, largely because thylacines are thought to be considerably larger than dingoes. Thus, other concurrent factors, such as shifts in human technology and population increase as well as climate change, have been cited to explain their extinction. Here we present new morphological evidence that female mainland Holocene thylacines were actually smaller than dingoes. We discuss these findings against archaeological and contemporary ecological evidence concerning dingoes' environmental impacts, and provide evidence that, as novel predators, dingoes induced a trophic cascade that had dramatic impacts on the fauna and economy of Holocene Australia. We suggest that dingoes, owing to their larger brains and body size, were likely a primary agent for the extinction of the thylacine from mainland Australia.},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. "Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever." (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.).},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

Energetic costs of such strategies can vary from high-cost mobbing, via less costly alarm calling, to low-cost furtive concealment. Here we report the anti-predation strategies of red-nosed cuxi{\'{u}}, Chiropotes albinasus, based on direct observations from four study sites in southeastern Brazilian Amazonia. Over a collective period of 1255 fieldwork hours, we observed nine direct interactions between raptors (all potential predators) and red-nosed cuxi{\'{u}}s. Of these, one (11{\%}) resulted in predation. Raptors involved were: Harpia harpyja (four events), Leucopternis sp. (two events), Spiza{\"{e}}tus tyrannus (one event), and unidentified large raptors (two events). Predation attempts occurred in flooded-forest and terra firme rainforest, were directed at both adult and non-adult cuxi{\'{u}}s, and involved both adult and juvenile raptors. Anti-predation strategies adopted by the cuxi{\'{u}}s included: (1) group defence and mobbing behaviour (two occasions), (2) dropping into dense sub-canopy (seven occasions), (3) alarm calling (eight occasions), and (4) fleeing to, and hiding in, dense vegetation (eight occasions). During each encounter at least two of these behaviours were recorded. These are the first published records of predation, predation attempts, and anti-predator behaviour involving red-nosed cuxi{\'{u}}. {\textcopyright} 2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.},

abstract = {Advances in tracking technology have led to an exponential increase in animal location data, greatly enhancing our ability to address interesting questions in movement ecology, but also presenting new challenges related to data management and analysis. Step-selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four-step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.},

abstract = {Although environmental conditions and biotic interactions are widely recognized as key sources of variation in circadian activity rhythms of a broad array of vertebrates, information on their actual significance outside experimental settings remains scarce. We investigated changes in circadian activity rhythms of free-ranging Cabrera voles, Microtus cabrerae, and water voles, Arvicola sapidus, in highly seasonal Mediterranean environments, and analysed how such changes were further affected by intersexual and interspecific interactions. Cabrera voles were largely diurnal, with a unimodal peak around midday during the wet season, whereas during the dry season activity was reduced during the hot midday period and increased strongly at dawn and dusk. Water voles also had a marked bimodal crepuscular pattern during the dry season, but this was much attenuated during the wet season, when they were comparatively more diurnal. Activity patterns varied little between the sexes, although with a tendency for higher overall activity by male Cabrera voles (dry season only) and water voles, possibly because of intersexual interactions involving seasonal shifts from monogamy to facultative polygyny in Cabrera voles, and year-round polygyny in water vole. Within each season, Cabrera voles appeared to change their activity patterns in the presence of water voles, reducing overall activity and shifting activity peaks towards diurnal (dry season) or crepuscular (wet season) time periods less used by water voles. Overall, this study provides evidence for the strong role of seasonal changes in environmental conditions and interspecific interactions in driving variation in the activity patterns of Mediterranean voles under natural conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

The animal was allowed to move freely in an outside enclosure and artificial sett whilst movements were recorded using a video camera. Data were analysed using custom-written software in terms of magnitude of movement, posture and periodicity using spectral analysis, a principal component analysis, the k-nearest neighbour algorithm and a decision tree to facilitate the automated classification of behaviours.

The pellet-group counting method has been used to evaluate density of the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). This species is an important component of human diet in tropical habitats. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare density estimates using four methods: counts in circular plots (FSC, Fecal Standing Crop and FAR, Fecal Accumulation Rate), and counts in transects (LT, Line Transect and ST, Strip Transect); 2) simulate the effect of increased sampling effort on density and precision, and; 3) evaluate the effort required to detect changes in population density using LT. From 2006 to 2007, we intensively sampled a 1 km2 quadrant in a Mexican tropical dry forest. The results indicate that all four methods produce similar mean population density estimates. However, estimates of precision were dependent on sample size which in turn was associated with the particular counting method used. In descending order of estimate precision, the methods ranked as: LT, ST, FSC, and FAR. To detect population changes of {\textless} 20{\%}, we suggest the establishment of 5 to 22 transects (LT) of 390 m during the dry season. To reduce bias in density estimation, it is important to obtain defecation and pellet decomposition rates in the study site.},

abstract = {Many analytical techniques that assess resource selection focus on individual relocation points as the sample unit and classify resources as either used or available. Commonly, the relative use of each resource is quantified as the number of observations in each resource class or the proportional occurrence of a resource within a home range. We believe that a more accurate estimate can be summarized by a utilization distribution (UD). We present an analytical approach that explicitly incorporates a probabilistic measure of use, as defined by the UD. We used animal relocation points and fixed-kernel techniques to determine a UD within a home range. We related this probabilistic measure of use to,categorical and continuous resource variables using multiple regression. Regression errors accounted for spatial autocorrelation so that the significance of regression coefficients could be appraised for each animal and averaged across animals. This allowed us to quantify the individualistic nature of resource selection and test for consistency in use of resources by a population. Sample sizes in population assessments correctly reflected the individual animal as the experimental unit. We used this technique in a geographic information system setting to examine the importance of local-scale (forest cover) and landscape-scale (degree of fragmentation, proximity to edges and human use areas) attributes to breeding season habitat selection by 25 radio-tagged Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) in western Washington State, USA. Individual jays varied significantly in habitat use, but most (20) concentrated their use in areas with many vegetation patches or in areas with extensive edge between forest and nonforested land cover. This confirmed our prediction that jays prefer fragmented habitat and forest edges and helped to explain why jays are most abundant in fragmented landscapes. However, we refined our, understanding of why they used such habitats by demonstrating that landscape attributes. affected use of local habitat features:high-contrast edges were used most if they were associated with small human settlements and campgrounds. Use of patchy and edgy areas within home ranges may be reinforced by natural selection because jays that inhabited areas with complex-shaped patches and concentrated their activity in such areas were most likely to fledge young. Concentration of use along forest-human land use interfaces may explain the greater risk of nest predation to other birds in such settings.},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivores have adapted to successfully occupy a wide range of
environments spanning tropical to polar ecosystems. Some species,
however, have evolved in ways that constrain their ability to thrive in
extreme environmental conditions. For example many members of the Family
Mustelidae are vulnerable to extreme temperatures resulting from their
tubular body shape. The American mink (Neovison vison) likely faces
these temperature constraints, being a smaller-bodied mustelid that
ranges over a large portion of North America. Mink are largely
understudied in its native range with knowledge being particularly
sparse with respect to winter ecology. During 2011-2012 we conducted
winter telemetry on seven adult mink and used resource selection
function models to assess habitat selection patterns while considering
spatial extent and gender. We found that at a larger extent, the
animals' use of habitat was strongly linked to riparian features,
whereas this effect was less noticeable at a finer scale. The larger
males selected more lakeshore habitat, whereas the smaller females
generally were near smaller streams with both selecting for beaver
modified habitat. While we recognize the limited sample size in our
study, we speculate that this spatial separation could be linked to
higher energetic costs for females to forage aquatically in winter
because of their smaller body size. This may make females more sensitive
to competition from other forest carnivores (e.g. American marten) as
well as impacts from resource development activities.},

abstract = {The effects of photoperiod, temperature and rearing density on the rate of sexual maturation were studied to clarify the life cycle strategy in a bivoltine population of Locusta migratora L. in Japan. The time required for 50{\%} of females to start oviposition was longer at a longer photoperiod when they were crowded as hoppers and isolated as pairs of adults. Crowding combined with long days suppressed sexual maturation. This suppression appears related to migratory activity. When exposed to short days, crowded locusts deposited eggs shortly after adult emergence, preparing the species for overwintering in the egg stage. In locusts isolated as hoppers and adults, the reproductive suppression occurring at an intermediate photoperiod was less intense than at a long photoperiod. Field-collected solitary locusts kept as pairs under laboratory and outdoor conditions showed a conspicuous seasonal variation in the pre-oviposition period. The estimated amount of heat experienced during the pre-oviposition period was relatively small at the beginning and the end of the growing season, and large in mid-summer when locusts encountered intermediate daylengths and high temperatures. This control of sexual maturation is temperature-compensated because locusts in the second generation did not show any marked delay in oviposition in a cool year. These responses appear related closely to phase polymorphism and voltinism.},

abstract = {Data loggers were utilized to record depth, temperature, biaxial motion and swimming speed for female green turtles Chelonia mydas between nesting events in Thailand. The present study demonstrated clear alternations in swimming effort with depth. Both resident and maximum dive depths significantly affected flipper beat frequency, suggesting that turtles change flipper beat frequency with current buoyancy in ways similar to other diving mammals and birds. Body angles became steepest during the initial phases of descent and ascent, but were {\textless}60 degrees. Swimming speeds were related to flipper beat frequency and current buoyancy. Swimming speeds based on the dominant stroke frequency during the inter-nesting period (0.18 to 0.21 Hz) were estimated at 0.52 to 0.60 curved carapace lengths s(-1). These values are similar to the modal speeds of the leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea and the mean speeds during the initial descent of the loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta. We calculated the dynamic body acceleration (DBA) as the index of activity during the descent and ascent phases and found a relationship between maximum dive depth and DBA. Although active stroking during deeper dives may result in a shorter dive duration, daytime dives (ca. 16 to 26 m) were deeper than those observed during the night (ca. 9 to 13 m). This result suggests a beneficial reproductive strategy for females that involves changes in vertical space, for example, to obtain refuge from energy-consuming encounters with males or predators},

abstract = {Within a landscape where prey has an aggregated distribution, predators can take advantage of the spatial autocorrelation of prey density and intensify their search effort in areas of high prey density by using area-restricted search behaviour. In African arid and semi-arid savannas, large herbivores tend to aggregate around scarce water sources. We tested the hypothesis that water sources are a key determinant of habitat selection and movement patterns of large free-ranging predators in such savannas, using the example of the African lion. We used data from 19 GPS radio-collared lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Maps of lions' trajectories showed that waterholes are key loci on the lions' route-maps. Compositional analyses revealed that lions significantly selected for areas located within 2 km of a waterhole. In addition, analysis of lions' night paths showed that when lions are close to a waterhole ({\textless}2 km), they move at lower speed, cover shorter distances per night (both path length and net displacement) and follow a more tortuous path (higher turning angle, lower straightness index and higher fractal dimension) than when they are further from a waterhole. Hence, our results strongly suggest that lions adopt area-restricted searching in the vicinity of waterholes, and reduce their search effort to minimize the time spent far from a waterhole. They provide an illustration of how key habitat features that determine the dispersion of prey (e.g. waterholes in this study) have an influence on the spatial ecology and movement patterns of terrestrial predators. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

However, at least seven ecological and sociological considerations must be addressed before dog populations are positively managed. 1. Domestication and feralisation of dingoes have resulted in behavioural changes that continue to expose a broad range of native and introduced fauna to predation. 2. Dingoes and other dogs are classic mesopredators, while humans are the apex predator and primary ecosystem engineers in Australia. 3. Anthropogenic landscape changes could prevent modern dingoes from fulfilling their pre-European roles. 4. Dingoes areknownto exploitmanyof the same species they are often presumed to ‘protect', predisposing them to present direct risks to many threatened species. 5. The assertion that contemporary dog control facilitates the release of mesopredators disregards the realities of effective dog control, which simultaneously reduces fox and dog abundance and is unlikely to enable increases in fox abundance. 6. The processes affecting threatened fauna are likely a combination of both top-down and bottom-up effects, which will not be solved or reversed by concentrating efforts on managing only predator effects. 7. Mostimportantly,humansocial andeconomic niches are highly variable across the ecosystems where dingoes are present or proposed. Human perceptions will ultimately determine acceptance of positive dingo management. Outside of an adaptive management framework, positively managing dingoes while ignoring these seven considerations is unlikely to succeed in conserving native faunal biodiversity but is likely to have negative effects on ecological, social and economic values.},

Here we examine food and dietary items identified in scats of dingoes in peri-urban areas of north-eastern Australia to better understand their resource requirements and the potential for dingoes to threaten locally fragmented populations of native fauna. Our primary aim was to determine what peri-urban dingoes eat, and whether or not this differs between regions. We identified over 40 different food items in dingo scats, almost all of which were mammals. Individual species commonly observed in dingo scats included agile wallabies, northern brown bandicoots and swamp wallabies. Birds were relatively common in some areas but not others, as were invertebrates. Dingoes were identified as a significant potential threat to fragmented populations of koalas. Dietary overlap was typically very high or near-identical between regions, indicating that peri-urban dingoes ate the same types or sizes of prey in different areas. Future studies should seek to quantify actual and perceived impacts of, and human attitudes towards, peri-urban dingoes, and to develop management strategies with a greater chance of reducing human-wildlife conflicts.},

abstract = {Guppies are a model vertebrate for studies of sexual selection and life history evolution. None the less, there have been few investigations of the factors responsible for maintaining extreme within-population genetic variation in male coloration. In a laboratory study, we tested the hypothesis that frequency-dependent mate choice contributes to the maintenance of this variation. We attempted to avoid biases inherent in earlier studies of the 'rare male effect' by familiarizing females to males bearing a particular colour pattern and later presenting them with alternate male types, in equal numbers. Females were significantly more likely to mate with males having novel colour patterns than with males having a colour pattern with which they were familiar. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that mate choice is frequency dependent. Other factors such as male and female size were unrelated to mate preference. Implications of the results for theories of sexual selection and the maintenance of variation are discussed. Copyright 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {1. Free-ranging domestic dogs are the world's most common carnivore and can negatively interact with native wildlife at multiple levels. Yet the intraguild competitive effects of dogs on the distribution and habitat use of native carnivores are poorly known, especially in areas of conservation concern.  2. We examined the spatial distribution of sympatric populations of radiocollared Indian foxes and free-ranging dogs to determine if Indian foxes alter their habitat use in the presence of dogs. We tested the effects of landcover type, primary prey abundance (rodents) and the presence of dogs as predictors of Indian fox spatial distribution in a threatened grassland habitat in central India.  3. By counting rodent burrows, we determined that the relative abundance of rodents was higher in fallow land and agricultural land compared to natural grasslands. From radiotelemetry data, we determined that the presence of dogs was closely linked to human-modified habitats, such as agricultural land and human settlements.  4. Top ranked models, based on Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size, indicated that the negative effects of the presence of dogs and agricultural land, and the positive effects of the presence of grassland and fallow land habitats were the strongest predictors of Indian fox spatial distribution. Thus, the use of the landscape by Indian foxes was determined not only by habitat type, but also by the presence of a mid-sized carnivore, the dog.  5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the presence of domestic dogs on the periphery of natural habitats can interfere with the spatial distribution of a sympatric carnivore. Vaccination and sterilization programmes, aimed at reducing population sizes and pathogen prevalence, do not restrict the free-ranging behaviour of dogs. Therefore, in areas of conservation value, control of free-ranging dogs would be required to fully mitigate the deleterious effects of dogs on native carnivores and other wildlife.},

In a problem-solving task, snakes housed in enriched environments (EC) exhibited shorter latencies to the goal hole as compared to snakes housed in standard conditions (SC). In an open field task, EC snakes tended to habituate more quickly than SC snakes with repeated testing. A feeding task did not reveal any significant differences between EC and SC snakes. A discriminant function analysis correctly assigned all snakes to their appropriate housing treatment groups, based on the responses in each of the behavioral tasks. This suggests that each group had a distinct behavioral profile; that is, EC snakes were more behaviorally adaptive than SC snakes. This study demonstrated that housing conditions can affect the behavior of captive snakes and produce improvements in behavior similar to those seen in mammalian enrichment studies.},

abstract = {With the extirpation of apex predators from many North American systems, coyotes Canis latrans have become the de facto top predator and are ubiquitous members of most ecosystems. Keystone predators aid in maintaining ecosystem function by regulating the mammal community through direct predation and instilling the landscape of fear, yet the value of coyotes regulating systems to this capacity is understudied and likely variable across environments. Since coyotes are common in the Midwestern United States, we utilized camera traps and occupancy analyses to as- sess their role in regulating the distribution of mammalian herbivores in a fragmented suburban ecosystem. Forest cover was a strong positive predictor of white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus detection, while coyote occurrence had a negative effect. Coyotes exerted a negative effect on squirrel (Sciurus spp.) and eastern cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus occurrence, while urban cover was a positive predictor for the prey species' occurrence. These results suggest all 3 species behaviorally avoid coyotes whereby deer seek denser forest cover and squirrels and cottontails mitigate risk by increasing use of urban areas. Although previous studies reveal limited influence of coyote on the rest of the carnivore guild in suburban systems, we suggest coyotes play an important role in regulating the herbivorous mammals and hence may provide similar eco- logical benefits in urban/suburban forest fragments through trophic cascades. Furthermore, since hunting may not be allowed in urban and suburban habitats, coyotes might also serve as the pri- mary regulator of nuisance species occurring at high abundance such as white-tailed deer and squirrels.},

abstract = {Predator-induced stress has been used to exemplify the concept of stress for close to a century because almost everyone can imagine the terror of fleeing for one's life from a lion or a tiger. Yet, because it has been assumed to be acute and transitory, predator-induced stress has not been much studied by either comparative physiologists or population ecologists, until relatively recently. The focus in biomedical research has always been on chronic stress in humans, which most comparative physiologists would agree results from 'sustained psychological stress - linked to mere thoughts' rather than 'acute physical crises' (like surviving a predator attack) or 'chronic physical challenges' (such as a shortage of food). Population ecologists have traditionally focused solely on the acute physical crisis of surviving a direct predator attack rather than whether the risk of such an attack may have a sustained effect on other demographic processes (e.g. the birth rate). Demographic experiments have now demonstrated that exposure to predators or predator cues can have sustained effects that extend to affecting birth and survival in free-living animals, and a subset of these have documented associated physiological stress effects. These and similar results have prompted some authors to speak of an 'ecology of fear', but others object that 'the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding predation remain unknown'. Recent biomedical studies on animals in the laboratory have demonstrated that exposure to predators or predator cues can induce 'sustained psychological stress' that is directly comparable to chronic stress in humans, and this has now in fact become one of the most common stressors used in studies of the animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We review these recent findings and suggest ways the laboratory techniques developed to measure the 'neural circuitry of fear' could be adapted for use on free-living animals in the field, in order to: (i) test whether predator risk induces 'sustained psychological stress' in wild animals, comparable to chronic stress in humans and (ii) directly investigate 'the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding predation' and hence the 'ecology of fear'. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

Brief periods of handling in captivity thus do not appear to cause chronic stress in the study species, although container restraint did appear to result in short-term stress in pythons.},

abstract = {Advances in bio-telemetry technology have made it possible to automatically monitor and classify behavioural activities in many animals, including domesticated species such as dairy cows. Automated behavioural classification has the potential to improve health and welfare monitoring processes as part of a Precision Livestock Farming approach. Recent studies have used accelerometers and pedometers to classify behavioural activities in dairy cows, but such approaches often cannot discriminate accurately between biologically important behaviours such as feeding, lying and standing or transition events between lying and standing. In this study we develop a decision-tree algorithm that uses tri-axial accelerometer data from a neck-mounted sensor to both classify biologically important behaviour in dairy cows and to detect transition events between lying and standing.},

abstract = {The rapid worldwide emergence of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is having a profound negative impact on biodiversity. However, global research efforts are fragmented and an overarching synthesis of global infection data is lacking. Here, we provide results from a community tool for the compilation of worldwide Bd presence and report on the analyses of data collated over a four-year period. Using this online database, we analysed: 1) spatial and taxonomic patterns of infection, including amphibian families that appear over- and under-infected; 2) relationships between Bd occurrence and declining amphibian species, including associations among Bd occurrence, species richness, and enigmatic population declines; and 3) patterns of environmental correlates with Bd, including climate metrics for all species combined and three families (Hylidae, Bufonidae, Ranidae) separately, at both a global scale and regional (U.S.A.) scale. These associations provide new insights for downscaled hypothesis testing. The pathogen has been detected in 52 of 82 countries in which sampling was reported, and it has been detected in 516 of 1240 (42{\%}) amphibian species. We show that detected Bd infections are related to amphibian biodiversity and locations experiencing rapid enigmatic declines, supporting the hypothesis that greater complexity of amphibian communities increases the likelihood of emergence of infection and transmission of Bd. Using a global model including all sampled species, the odds of Bd detection decreased with increasing temperature range at a site. Further consideration of temperature range, rather than maximum or minimum temperatures, may provide new insights into Bd-host ecology. Whereas caution is necessary when interpreting such a broad global dataset, the use of our pathogen database is helping to inform studies of the epidemiology of Bd, as well as enabling regional, national, and international prioritization of conservation efforts. We provide recommendations for adaptive management to enhance the database utility and relevance.},

abstract = {In this paper we compare some socio-ecological traits of feral dogs and wolves in order to assess the social ecology of feral dogs in terms of its adaptive value in the natural environment, and to evaluate to what extent the domestication process altered the wolf's socio-ecological patterns. Referring to feral dogs as those dogs living in a wild state with no food and shelter intentionally provided by humans, and showing a continuous and strong avoidance of direct human contacts, we review the currently available information on feral dog ecology, and particular reference is made to a 3-year term project on feral dog ecology in Abruzzo, Italy. Through comparison of relevant behavioural and ecological features of both wolves and feral dogs, we hypothesize that some aspects of the feral dogs' ecology, having escaped natural selection pressures, represent primarily expression of ''evolutionary inertia'' or an epiphenomena of artificial selection. Fitness-related measures of sociality, demography, reproduction, space-use, activity patterns, and feeding ecology in feral dogs tend to support our original hypothesis: feral dogs are not reproductively self-sustaining, suffer from high rates of juvenile mortality, depend indirectly upon humans for food, co-optable individuals, and space, and their demography appears dominated by unpredictable mechanisms. However, further research is needed, especially concerning different ecological conditions and multi-generational time-scales, as well as the role that dominant breed-types and cross-breeding history within feral dog groups might play in the expression of the analyzed socio-ecological features},

abstract = {The global focus on wildlife as a major contributor to emerging pathogens and infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans and domestic animals is not based on field, experimental or dedicated research, but mostly on limited surveys of literature, opinion and the assumption that biodiversity harbours pathogens. The perceived and direct impacts of wildlife, from being a reservoir of certain human and livestock pathogens and as a risk to health, are frequently overstated when compared to the Global burden of disease statistics available from WHO, OIE and FAO. However organisms that evolve in wildlife species can and do spill-over into human landscapes and humans and domestic animal population and, where these organisms adapt to surviving and spreading amongst livestock and humans, these emerging infections can have significant consequences. Drivers for the spill-over of pathogens or evolution of organisms from wildlife reservoirs to become pathogens of humans and domestic animals are varied but almost without exception poorly researched. The changing demographics, spatial distribution and movements, associated landscape modifications (especially agricultural) and behavioural changes involving human and domestic animal populations are probably the core drivers of the apparent increasing trend in emergence of new pathogens and infectious diseases over recent decades.},

abstract = {Should prey retain an ability to respond to the sight of their extinct predators? The multipredator hypothesis (Blumstein 2006, Ethology, 112, 209-217) assumes that antipredator adaptations evolve together and thus prey may respond to extinct predators as long as they have experience with other predators. We tested this prediction in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, a species with both extant and extinct predators. Marmots were baited to a predetermined location and then shown one of five life-size photographic stimuli: a medium-size sub-Saharan antelope, the gray duiker, Silvicapra grimmia, as a control stimulus; a red fox, Vulpes vulpes, a low-risk predator; a coyote, Canis latrans, a higher risk predator; a mountain lion, Felis concolor, an extant predator, but one with which our population had no ontogenetic experience; and a wolf, Canis lupus, an extinct predator. Marmots responded differently to each stimulus: they stopped foraging after seeing the duiker, engaged in low vigilance after seeing the fox, seemed to monitor the coyote, fled the wolf, and engaged in high vigilance (and on one occasion alarm-called) in response to the mountain lion. This pattern of responses was consistent with the different risks associated with each species: foxes required monitoring but marmots could generally escape them, coyotes routinely kill adult marmots, solitary hunting mountain lions might be dissuaded from attack once detected, and socially hunting wolves were a very high risk predator, which would be best hidden from. The pattern of responses was not explained simply by stimulus size, stimulus detectability, or stimulus similarity. These results are consistent with the multipredator hypothesis: visual predator discrimination for ontogenetically and evolutionarily novel predators may be maintained in yellow-bellied marmots by extant predation risk. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Research is split into three separate areas of inquiry - movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach - which have developed without much productive contact. Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.},

Areas of concern are sampling level, data pooling across individuals, non-independence of habitat proportions, differential habitat use by groups of animals, and arbitrary definition of habitat availability. We advocate proportional habitat use by individual animals as a basis for analysis. Hypothesis testing of such nonstandard multivariate data is done by compositional analysis, which encom- passes all MANOVA/MANCOVA-type linear models. The applications to habitat use range from testing for age class effects or seasonal differences, to examining relationships with food abundance or home range size. We take as an example the comparison of habitat use and availability. The concepts are explained and demonstrated on two data sets, illustrating different methods of treating missing values. We compare utilized with available habitats in two stages, examining home range selection within the overall study area first, then habitat use within the home range. At each stage, assuming that use differs from random, habitats can be ranked according to relative use, and significant between-rank differences located. Compositional analysis is also suited to the analysis of time budgets or diets.},

abstract = {The presence of exotic predators in ecosystems across the world is a leading driver of native species' declines. Exotic predators largely influence native species through predation and harassment, which may cause native species to avoid them spatially. We used a camera trap dataset from seven sites in Madagascar's largest protected area complex to investigate spatial co-occurrence patterns between three exotic predators (free-ranging domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis silvestris, and small Indian civet Viverricula indica) and native ground-dwelling forest birds (n = 5) and small mammals (n = 4). We created 216 two-species occupancy models for 27 exotic predator-native species pairings to examine how habitat, exotic predator presence or both, influenced each native species' occupancy and/or detection. We found that native bird and small mammal occupancy and/or detection were strongly related to an exotic predator's presence 52{\%} of the time (i.e. 14 of 27 exotic predator-native species pairings). Six of the 14 species pairings (i.e. 43{\%}) had non-independent co-occurrence patterns, four of which were habitat-mediated. The effect of exotic predator presence on native species' detection was largely negative, depressing native species' detection in seven out of 12 instances (i.e. 58{\%} of the time). The small Indian civet and free-ranging cats each strongly influenced the occupancy and/or detection of six species for a combined impact on seven native species, while domestic dogs strongly influenced two species. By including habitat covariates in two-species occupancy models, we gained deeper insight into the effect exotic predator presence has on native species' distribution. We also note that the strong effect of exotic predator presence on our ability to detect native species can hinder the ability of researchers to provide accurate parameter estimates. We recommend future research into the synergistic effects that habitat degradation and exotic species presence has on native species.},

abstract = {Aggression by top predators can create a " landscape of fear " in which subordinate pred-ators restrict their activity to low-risk areas or times of day. At large spatial or temporal scales, this can result in the costly loss of access to resources. However, fine-scale reac-tive avoidance may minimize the risk of aggressive encounters for subordinate preda-tors while maintaining access to resources, thereby providing a mechanism for coexistence. We investigated fine-scale spatiotemporal avoidance in a guild of African predators characterized by intense interference competition. Vulnerable to food steal-ing and direct killing, cheetahs are expected to avoid both larger predators; hyenas are expected to avoid lions. We deployed a grid of 225 camera traps across 1,125 km 2 in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to evaluate concurrent patterns of habitat use by lions, hyenas, cheetahs, and their primary prey. We used hurdle models to evaluate whether smaller species avoided areas preferred by larger species, and we used time-to-event models to evaluate fine-scale temporal avoidance in the hours immediately surrounding top predator activity. We found no evidence of long-term displacement of subordinate species, even at fine spatial scales. Instead, hyenas and cheetahs were positively associated with lions except in areas with exceptionally high lion use. Hyenas and lions appeared to actively track each, while cheetahs appear to maintain long-term access to sites with high lion use by actively avoiding those areas just in the hours im-mediately following lion activity. Our results suggest that cheetahs are able to use patches of preferred habitat by avoiding lions on a moment-to-moment basis. Such fine-scale temporal avoidance is likely to be less costly than long-term avoidance of preferred areas: This may help explain why cheetahs are able to coexist with lions despite high rates of lion-inflicted mortality, and highlights reactive avoidance as a general mechanism for predator coexistence.},

abstract = {The Asian water monitor Varanus salvator is the second-largest lizard species in the world (to {\textgreater} 1 m SVL, 2.5 m total, 20 kg), and is heavily exploited ({\textgreater} 1 million skins per annum). In the course of three trips between August 1993 and April 1995, we gathered information on 166 water monitors captured in southern Sumatra for the commercial skin trade. Relatively equal numbers of males and females were captured, but the males were almost all adults whereas half of the females were juveniles. Sex ratios and body sizes did not vary significantly among the three trips. Males grow larger than females, but the largest animals are not used in the leather trade. Males mature at around 40 cm SVL (= 1 m total, 1 kg), and females at around 50 cm. Maturation thus occurs at a small proportion of maximum size, as is typical for large species of reptiles. Adult males are more heavy-bodied than females, and have longer tails, but fat stores did not differ between the sexes. Prey items included crustaceans, rats and other varanids, but most lizards were kept for so long prior to slaughter that the stomach was empty of food. All adult-size males had active gonads, but testes were larger in April than in October. All adult females in the August and April samples were reproductively active, but less activity was evident in October. The egg-laying season extends from April to October. The egg-laying season extends from April to October (at least), and most female water monitors in southern Sumatra produce multiple clutches each year. Larger females began to breed earlier in the year than do smaller animals. Clutch sizes ranged from five to 22, and were positively correlated with maternal body size. We measured stretched and dried skins from processed lizards to establish a predictive equation linking lizard SVL to skin width. The persistence of water monitors in southern Sumatra, despite intense harvesting, reflects the large area of suitable habitat with low human densities, combined with the monitors' ecological flexibility (in habitat and diets), their high reproductive rate (early maturation and frequent reproduction), and (perhaps) the concentration of commercial harvesting on adult males.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Zoological Society of London. Domestic dogs are increasingly being recognized as a conservation threat for native species. In many places, their impacts may be as severe as other invasive predators such as cats and rats. We conducted the first ever sub-continent scale assessment of the impacts of dogs on native species in India using an online key informant survey and reports from national print media. Dogs reportedly attacked 80 species, of which 31 were IUCN Red list threatened species, including four Critically Endangered species. Larger bodied mammals such as ungulates and carnivores, were most commonly reported to be attacked, although this may be an observation bias. Approximately 68{\%} of the attacks were carried out by dogs unaccompanied by humans. Most of the attacks were carried out by packs of dogs with 45{\%} of these attacks leading to the death of the prey. Nearly 48{\%} of the incidents were reported in and around wildlife protected areas, suggesting that dogs are an important large-scale edge effect around protected areas in India. For Critically Endangered species that are already suffering from serious population declines due to other causes, the impact of dogs may seriously impede population recovery efforts. Mitigating the impacts of dogs on wildlife requires a multi-pronged approach of responsible dog ownership, restriction in free-ranging behaviour, and strong population control measures, especially around sensitive conservation areas.},

The Gray Wolf is the largest canid and their roles in food webs are much researched, as are those of Domestic Dogs, Coyotes and Red Foxes. Much less is known about the other canid species and their ecological roles.Here we describe general food web theory and the potential application of network theory to it; summarise the possible roles of predators in food webs; document the occurrence, diet and presumed functions that canids play in food webs throughout the world; give case studies of four threatened canid species of top, middle and basal trophic positions and six anthropogenically affected species; and identify knowledge limitations and propose research frameworks necessary to establish the roles of canids in food webs.Canids can be top-down drivers of systems or responsive to the availability of resources including suitable prey. They can be affected anthropogenically by habitat change, lethal control and changes to basic resource availability. They can be sustainable yield harvesters of their indigenous prey or passengers in complex ecosystems, and some are prey of larger canids and of other predators. Nevertheless, the roles of most canids are generally poorly studied and described, and some, e.g. Gray Wolves, Coyotes and Australian dingoes, are controversial. We advocate mensurative and experimental research into communities and ecosystems containing canids for a quantitative understanding of their roles in food webs and consequent development of better management strategies for ecosystems.},

Here we used global positioning system (GPS) devices to remotely monitor adult lace monitor behaviour across two summer seasons in a coastal habitat adjacent to a sea turtle nesting beach at Wreck Rock, Queensland, Australia. GPS tracking showed that lace monitors spent most of their time in woodland habitat away from the seafront dune areas. Both adult males and females occupied relatively large home ranges (0.005 to 1.467 km2 calculated by the Kernel Brownian Bridge method) and individual home ranges overlapped each other to a large extent. The space use patterns of individual lace monitors could be classified as ‘linear' or ‘clumped', indicating plasticity in this species' movement behaviour. Because lace monitors rarely visited the frontal dune area where sea turtles nest, they do not pose a significant threat to sea turtle nests.},

However, because of a lack of homologous squamate non-toxin sequences, these conclusions rely on the implicit assumption that recruitments of protein families into venom are both rare and irreversible. Here we use sequences of homologous non-toxin proteins from two snake species to test these assumptions. Phylogenetic and ancestral-state analyses revealed frequent nesting of 'physiological' proteins within venom toxin clades, suggesting early ancestral recruitment into venom followed by reverse recruitment of toxins back to physiological roles. These results provide evidence that protein recruitment into venoms from physiological functions is not a one-way process, but dynamic, with reversal of function and/or co-expression of toxins in different tissues. This requires a major reassessment of our previous understanding of how animal venoms evolve.},

There also is a need for comparative data evaluating new or seldom used methods. In an initial evaluation, we first surveyed wildlife managers for information on cage-trapping; using these data, we conducted a field study of 4 coyote (Canis latrans) capture systems for animal damage management. We tested the SoftCatch¬{\textregistered}‚{\`{a}}{\"{U}}, Collarum¬{\textregistered}‚{\`{a}}{\"{U}}, Wildlife Services-Turman, and Tomahawk¬{\textregistered}‚{\`{a}}{\"{U}}, systems for capturing coyotes in Arizona and south Texas during 2001 and 2002. We determined capture efficiency and selectivity and performed whole-body necropsies to identify trap-related injuries. Surveys indicated that coyotes usually were captured in large ({\textgreater}1.6-m-length) cage-traps baited with meat or carcasses. In our field evaluation, we estimated a capture efficiency (percentage of coyote captures per capture opportunity) of 0{\%} for the Tomahawk cage-trap, 87{\%} for the Collarum, 88{\%} for the WS-T throw arm, and 100{\%} for the SoftCatch. Cage-traps were the least selective, capturing 34 noncoyote animals, and Collarums were the most selective, capturing no noncoyote animals. The WS-T and SoftCatch devices showed intermediate selectivity of 50{\%} and 69{\%}, respectively. All devices showed low injury scores relative to jawed devices in previous studies; 92{\%}, 57{\%}, and 92{\%} of coyotes captured in the Collarum, WS-T, and SoftCatch showed no indicators of poor welfare, respectively.},

abstract = {Forest loss and fragmentation in Indonesia may seriously affect the survivorship of forest birds and lead to local extinction of bird populations. We used 786 artificial nests baited with quail eggs to examine the effect of habitat alteration on nest predation in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi. Natural forest and four habitats of forest margin areas: forest edge, forest gardens, coffee plantations, and secondary forest, were studied. Two types of artificial nests, ground and shrub nests were placed in these habitats at two different locations for a period of 8 days. In addition, we used automatic cameras and cage-traps to identify the predators. Nests in shrubs experienced significantly higher predation rates in forest margin areas than in natural forest. Predation on ground nests did not differ significantly between these habitat types, but was significantly higher than that on shrub nests in each habitat except forest edge. Rodents were the most common predators of both nests, but shrub nests were also susceptible to Dwarf cuscus (Strigocuscus celebensis), squirrels, and tree snakes. The nest predation rates we found were among the highest found in tropical rainforests, probably a consequence of the unique predator assemblages of Sulawesi. These results suggest that egg survival is negatively affected by human intervention and that human-induced habitats might have only limited importance for the conservation of Sulawesi's largely endemic understorey avifauna. These considerations might be important since forest margins comprise significant proportions of protected areas on Sulawesi and play an important role in future Park zoning concepts as well as in conservation-oriented land use management.},

Choosing an appropriate satellite tracking system for a project involves financial, technical and operational tradeoffs associated with different systems. Aim. The aim of the present research was to assess the technology options and associated costs to help wildlife researchers select the best tracking solution for their needs. Methods. A technology-choice decision guide was developed to assist wildlife scientists select an optimal tracking technology. We undertook four satellite tracking case studies involving avian, aquatic and terrestrial species living in diverse environments around the world and use these case studies to validate and test the technology-choice decision guide and to calculate the cost effectiveness of alternative tracking methods. Technologies used in marine tracking were out of the scope of the present paper. Key results. Choosing the tracking method best suited for a project requires (1) clearly specifying the data required to meet project objectives, (2) understanding the constraints imposed by the study species and its environment, and (3) calculating the net cost per datum of the various tracking methods available. Key conclusions. We suggest that, in most circumstances, global positioning system (GPS) tracking is preferable to other options. However, where weight and environmental limitations prevent the use of GPS, alternatives such as Argos satellite Doppler-based positions (Argos) or very high frequency (VHF) can function adequately. Implications. The present paper provides simplified criteria for selecting the best wildlife satellite tracking technology for different situations.},

abstract = {Free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, are an inte- gral part of the human environment in India and many other countries. They can serve as the perfect model system for understanding the process of deve- lopment of the human–dog relationship that led to the domestication of the wilder ancestors of the dogs and created ‘man's best friend'. Yet, very little is known about the ecoethology of these animals and all our un- derstanding of dog behaviour is based on studies of pets reared by humans. The free-ranging dogs lead a scavenging life, depending on human excesses for their survival, and rarely hunt. They are often considered as a menace by many people, as dirty animals that bark, bite and spread rabies. These notions are often founded on personal biases and little scientific data exist to either support or refute such claims. As part of an extended study on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging dogs in India, we carried out random sampling of dog behaviour through censuses in two cities and one township of India. We used our data from 1941 sightings to draw up a time activity budget of dogs during the part of the day when they share the streets with humans. Our analysis reveals that dogs are generally lazy and friendly animals, and their rare interactions with humans are typically submissive. Thus dogs do not usually pose a threat to human well- being, and proper management of our refuse and a tolerant, if not friendly attitude towards dogs can ensure their peaceful co-existence with us.},

abstract = {There is a need to quantify and better understand how wildlife interact with linear features, as these are integral elements of most landscapes. One potentially important aspect is linear feature tracking (LFT), yet studies rarely succeed in directly revealing or quantifying this behavior. In a proof-of-concept study, we employed short-term intensive GPS monitoring of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in a multiple-use landscape in southern Norway. Using periodic bursts of high frequency GPS position fixes, we performed modified path selection analyses to estimate the propensity of foxes to track natural and man-made linear features (roads, forest edges, and streams) once they are encountered. Foxes in our study tracked primarily forest edges and roads. Forty-three percent of bursts that encountered any linear feature resulted in LFT. LFT, although prominent, was manifested as a short-lived behavior, with overall median times to linear feature abandonment around two minutes. Movement speeds were highest along roads, perhaps due to greater ease of travel or higher perceived risk. In the highly heterogeneous habitats that characterize human-dominated landscapes, LFT may be manifested at such a fine spatio-temporal scale that it would remain hidden during telemetry studies employing conventional position fix frequencies. The approach described here may aid others studying spatial behaviors that are manifested over very short durations, yet are biologically significant.},

abstract = {Exendin-4 is a peptide produced exclusively by the salivary glands of the Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum. Although exendin-4 is considered a venom component, circulating plasma levels of exendin-4 have been shown to increase in response to feeding. Previous studies using mammals have demonstrated exendin-4 has prolonged plasma glucose-lowering properties. While these findings suggest a possible role of exendin-4 as a metabolic hormone in the Gila Monster, the mechanism controlling its release by the salivary gland has not previously been studied. We investigated possible factors driving exendin-4 release by testing Gila Monsters' response to one of six treatment groups: fed egg, fed juvenile rat, gastric intubation with egg while under anesthesia, olfactory stimulation from egg without ingestion, unfed control, and biting without feeding. These treatments were designed to separately test actions associated with feeding and different food types. We measured plasma exendin-4 levels using an immunoenzymetric assay before and at three time points after each treatment. Exendin-4 levels increased significantly in groups where considerable biting occurred but not in the other treatment groups. These results suggest that exendin-4 is released from the salivary glands in response to mechanical stimulation and not the detection of food either by smell, taste, or distention of the gut. Further study of exendin-4 in its natural organism is needed to elucidate the functional role of exendin-4 as a venom component and/or a metabolic regulator. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {I investigated the characteristics of moose (Alces alces) bycatch in kill snares set for wolves (Canis lupus) in interior and south-central Alaska, USA. My objective was to design a kill snare that would reduce moose vulnerability and injury if captured without reducing its effectiveness for capturing wolves. I documented at close range ({\textless}30 m) snare encounters by captive moose in natural habitat at the Kenai Moose Research Center (M RC) in south-central Alaska. Moose contacted 153 cm or 183 cm snares (n = 184) with their chest shoulder area (59.8{\%}), neck-head region (34.2{\%}), upper legs (3.8{\%}), and along the ribs (2.2{\%}). I documented the fate of moose following 225 snare contacts; 13.8{\%} were captured by the nose (5.8{\%}), leg (4.9{\%}), or unknown (3.1{\%}) with the remainder either knock-downs (65.3{\%}) or push-asides (21.0{\%}). Moose did not attempt to avoid snares. Of the 147 knock-downs, 86.4{\%} formed a loop 15-38 cm in diameter that laid near the snow surface continuing to present a potential trap for moose. I also evaluated capture rates by loop size for wild moose in 3 study areas in interior Alaska. Capture rate and type were not influenced by snare loop size or snow depth in the wild or the MRC. Capture vulnerability of wild and captive moose was higher in snares that were knock-downs by other moose or wind. I subsequently developed a snare that incorporated an additional wire (diverter) placed at a height that allowed moose or any ungulate taller than the set height of a wolf snare to contact and push the snare away prior to contact. This design reduced the vulnerability of moose but not wolves to capture. I also placed a cinch stop at 24.1-26.7 cm from the end stop of the snare loop to reduce injury to moose and act as a breakaway system without reducing the snare's effectiveness for capturing wolves. Results of this study are applicable to areas where wolf or coyote (Canis latrans) snaring occurs in the presence of moose and other large hoofed mammals.},

abstract = {Crayfish are aggressive animals that compete to acquire resources such as shelters, food, and mates. Shelters are a primary resource that crayfish use for protection from conspecifics and predators. Despite the importance of this resource, no field research has been performed that studies the acquisition and control of this resource. The present study examines shelter use in a natural habitat and the impact that shelter ownership has on the intensity and outcome of agonistic encounters. A stationary underwater camera was used to observe crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, shelter use and agonistic interactions in a natural lake environment. These shelters were formed naturally in iron outcroppings found on the limestone and detritus benthos. Crayfish activity and shelter use was found to be dependent upon a circadian cycle with most of the shelter use occurring during the morning to early afternoon (05:00-13:00 hours). Agonistic encounters in the presence of shelters resulted in shortZ, low intensity interactions. Interestingly, fight outcomes were not significantly affected by shelter ownership, but were primarily determined by size differential of combatants. This outcome may be due to the prevalence of shelters within this habitat. Contrary to laboratory studies, these results indicate that shelter ownership may not be an important factor in determining resource-holding potential in some habitats.},

abstract = {The impact of alien predators on native prey populations is often attributed to prey naivet{\'{e}} towards a novel threat. Yet evolutionary theory predicts that alien predators cannot remain eternally novel; prey species must either become extinct or learn and adapt to the new threat. As local enemies lose their naivet{\'{e}} and coexistence becomes possible, an introduced species must eventually become 'native'. But when exactly does an alien become a native species? The dingo (Canis lupus dingo) was introduced to Australia about 4000 years ago, yet its native status remains disputed. To determine whether a vulnerable native mammal (Perameles nasuta) recognizes the close relative of the dingo, the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), we surveyed local residents to determine levels of bandicoot visitation to yards with and without resident dogs. Bandicoots in this area regularly emerge from bushland to forage in residential yards at night, leaving behind tell-tale deep, conical diggings in lawns and garden beds. These diggings were less likely to appear at all, and appeared less frequently and in smaller quantities in yards with dogs than in yards with either resident cats (Felis catus) or no pets. Most dogs were kept indoors at night, meaning that bandicoots were not simply chased out of the yards or killed before they could leave diggings, but rather they recognized the threat posed by dogs and avoided those yards. Native Australian mammals have had thousands of years experience with wild dingoes, which are very closely related to domestic dogs. Our study suggests that these bandicoots may no longer be na{\"{i}}ve towards dogs. We argue that the logical criterion for determining native status of a long-term alien species must be once its native enemies are no longer na{\"{i}}ve.},

abstract = {The characteristic striped appearance of zebras has provoked much speculation about its function and why the pattern has evolved, but experimental evidence is scarce. Here, we demonstrate that a zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies (tabanids) than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents. Such biting flies are prevalent across Africa and have considerable fitness impact on potential mammalian hosts. Besides brightness, one of the likely mechanisms underlying this protection is the polarization of reflected light from the host animal. We show that the attractiveness of striped patterns to tabanids is also reduced if only polarization modulations (parallel stripes with alternating orthogonal directions of polarization) occur in horizontal or vertical homogeneous grey surfaces. Tabanids have been shown to respond strongly to linearly polarized light, and we demonstrate here that the light and dark stripes of a zebra's coat reflect very different polarizations of light in a way that disrupts the attractiveness to tabanids. We show that the attractiveness to tabanids decreases with decreasing stripe width, and that stripes below a certain size are effective in not attracting tabanids. Further, we demonstrate that the stripe widths of zebra coats fall in a range where the striped pattern is most disruptive to tabanids. The striped coat patterns of several other large mammals may also function in reducing exposure to tabanids by similar mechanisms of differential brightness and polarization of reflected light. This work provides an experimentally supported explanation for the underlying mechanism leading to the selective advantage of a black-and-white striped coat pattern.},

abstract = {Venom has only been recently discovered to be a basal trait of the Anguimorpha lizards. Consequently, very little is known about the timings of toxin recruitment events, venom protein molecular evolution, or even the relative physical diversifications of the venom system itself. A multidisciplinary approach was used to examine the evolution across the full taxonomical range of this ∼130 million-year-old clade. Analysis of cDNA libraries revealed complex venom transcriptomes. Most notably, three new cardioactive peptide toxin types were discovered (celestoxin, cholecystokinin, and YY peptides). The latter two represent additional examples of convergent use of genes in toxic arsenals, both having previously been documented as components of frog skin defensive chemical secretions. Two other novel venom gland-overexpressed modified versions of other protein frameworks were also recovered from the libraries (epididymal secretory protein and ribonuclease). Lectin, hyaluronidase, and veficolin toxin types were sequenced for the first time from lizard venoms and shown to be homologous to the snake venom forms. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the lizard natriuretic peptide toxins were recruited independently of the form in snake venoms. The de novo evolution of helokinestatin peptide toxin encoding domains within the lizard venom natriuretic gene was revealed to be exclusive to the helodermatid/anguid subclade. New isoforms were sequenced for cysteine-rich secretory protein, kallikrein, and phospholipase A(2) toxins. Venom gland morphological analysis revealed extensive evolutionary tinkering. Anguid glands are characterized by thin capsules and mixed glands, serous at the bottom of the lobule and mucous toward the apex. Twice, independently this arrangement was segregated into specialized serous protein-secreting glands with thick capsules with the mucous lobules now distinct (Heloderma and the Lanthanotus/Varanus clade). The results obtained highlight the importance of utilizing evolution-based search strategies for biodiscovery and emphasize the largely untapped drug design and development potential of lizard venoms.},

We conducted a survey of the inhabitants of three villages (Mazunte, Puerto Angel, and R{\'{i}}o Seco), whose main economic activities were tourism, fishing, and farming (n = 99), and a survey of tourists (n = 151). Dogs were the most commonly kept animals in all the villages. Cultural and economic aspects were reflected in dog-keeping practices. All dog owners allowed their dog(s) to roam free in the farming village (R{\'{i}}o Seco), but not in the tourist villages (Mazunte and Puerto Angel). Significantly more dog owners in the tourist village of Mazunte mentioned companionship as a reason for keeping dogs than those in the farming village. All villagers perceived as a problem that there were too many dogs. The mean number of dogs per household was 1.8, and there were significantly more male dogs in the farming village than in the tourist villages. Efforts to control the dog population in the rural coastal region are aimed at rabies prevention or wildlife protection, whereas this study revealed that these issues were far less often mentioned by local people as other dog-related problems. Significantly more villagers in the tourist villages perceived there to be dog-welfare problems than those in the farming village. Significantly more North American and European tourists were concerned about dog welfare than Mexican tourists. Despite significant differences in dog-keeping between the tourist and farming villages, opinions of villagers in regard to dog breeding and methods of dog population control were similar. Villagers agreed on dog sterilization to control the dog population, but also considered that female dogs should breed at least once in their lifetime. Those living in tourist villages could benefit from improving dog welfare and implementing strategies to lessen the problems dogs cause tourists. {\textcopyright} ISAZ 2012.},

abstract = {Distinguishing specific behavioural modes from data collected by animal-borne tri-axial accelerometers can be a time-consuming and subjective process. Data synthesis can be further inhibited when the tri-axial acceleration data cannot be paired with the corresponding behavioural mode through direct observation. Here, we explored the use of a tame surrogate (domestic dog) to build a behavioural classification module, and then used that module to accurately identify and quantify behavioural modes within acceleration collected from other individuals/species. Tri-axial acceleration data were recorded from a domestic dog whilst it was commanded to walk, run, sit, stand and lie-down. Through video synchronisation, each tri-axial acceleration sample was annotated with its associated behavioural mode; the feature vectors were extracted and used to build the classification module through the application of support vector machines (SVMs). This behavioural classification module was then used to identify and quantify the same behavioural modes in acceleration collected from a range of other species (alligator, badger, cheetah, dingo, echidna, kangaroo and wombat). Evaluation of the module performance, using a binary classification system, showed there was a high capacity ({\textgreater}90{\%}) for behaviour recognition between individuals of the same species. Furthermore, a positive correlation existed between SVM capacity and the similarity of the individual's spinal length-to-height above the ground ratio (SL:SH) to that of the surrogate. The study describes how to build a behavioural classification module and highlights the value of using a surrogate for studying cryptic, rare or endangered species.},

abstract = {The concept of an animal's home range has evolved over time, as have methods for estimating home-range size and shape. Recently, home-range estimation methods have focused on estimating an animal's utilization dis- tribution (UD; i.e., the probability distribution defining the animal's use of space). We illustrate the importance of the utilization distribution in characterizing the degree of overlap between home ranges (e.g., when assessing site fidelity or space-use sharing among individuals). We compare several different statistics for their ability to accurately rank paired examples in terms of their degree of overlap. These examples illustrate limitations of indices commonly used to quantify home-range overlap and suggest that new overlap indices that are a function of the UD are likely to be more informative. We suggest 2 new statistics for measuring home-range overlap: (1) for a measure of space- use sharing, we suggest a generalization of Hurlbert's (1978) E/Euniform statistic, which we term the utilization dis- tribution overlap index (UDOI), and (2) for a general measure of similarity between UD estimates, we suggest Bhat- tacharyya's affinity (BA; Bhattacharyya 1943). Using a short simulation study, we found that overlap indices can accurately rank pairs of UDs in terms of the extent of overlap, but estimates of overlap indices are likely to be biased. The extent of the bias depended on sample size and the degree of overlap (UDs with a high degree of over- lap resulted in statistics that were more biased [low]), suggesting that comparisons across studies may be problem- atic. We illustrate the use of overlap indices to quantify the degree of similarity among UD estimates obtained using 2 different data collection methods (Global Positioning Systems [GPS] and very high frequency [VHF] radio- telemetry) for an adult female northern white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in north-central Minnesota.},

Some are branched, others elongated and unbranched, some are small and numerous, while others are greatly enlarged. In most species the salivary glands are used to produce saliva, which lubricates the oral cavity, aids digestion and protects the oral mucosa and dentition. In some species, however, the glands have been modified so that they function in new and diverse ways. Examples include the ability to create thread from the salivary glands to create hides and cocoons, as shown by some arthropods, the ability to create nests out of saliva, as shown by the Aerodramus swiftlets, or the ability to produce venom from modified salivary glands. In this chapter these different adaptations will be discussed, looking at how the salivary glands have become adapted to their new role, with insights from developmental biology and evolution.},

abstract = {                    Passive acoustic monitoring is a potentially valuable tool in biodiversity hotspots, where surveying can occur at large scales across land conversion types. However, in order to extract meaningful biological information from resulting enormous acoustic datasets, rapid analytical techniques are required. Here we tested the ability of a suite of acoustic indices to predict avian bioacoustic activity in recordings collected from the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in southwestern India. Recordings were collected at 28 sites in a range of land-use types, from tea, coffee, and cardamom plantations to remnant forest stands. Using 36 acoustic indices we developed random forest models to predict the richness, diversity, and total number of avian vocalizations observed in recordings. We found limited evidence that acoustic indices predict the richness and total number of avian species vocalizations in recordings (R                    2                    {\textless} 0.51). However, acoustic indices predicted the diversity of avian species vocalizations with high accuracy (R                    2                    = 0.64, mean squared error = 0.17). Index models predicted low and high diversity best, with the highest residuals for medium diversity values and when continuous biological sounds were present (                    e.g.                    , insect sounds {\textgreater}8 sec). The acoustic complexity index and roughness index were the most important for predicting avian vocal diversity. Avian species richness was generally higher among shade-grown crops than in the open tea plantation. Our results suggest that models incorporating acoustic indices can accurately predict low and high avian species diversity from acoustic recordings. Thus, ecoacoustics could be an important contributor to biodiversity monitoring across landscapes like the Western Ghats, which are a complex mosaic of different land-use types and face continued changes in the future.                  },

Insects, which are part of the natural diet of fish, leave a small ecological footprint and have a limited need for arable land, may represent a good candidate. Over the last decade, studies of the replacement of fishmeal with insects in the diet of fish have emerged and the promising results have encouraged further research. The present review displays these results in tables and emphasizes the achievable dietary inclusion levels. It discusses the potential of locusts, grasshoppers, termites, yellow mealworms, Asiatic rhinoceros beetles, superworms, domesticated silkworms, common houseflies, common mosquitoes and black soldier flies for use as fishmeal and/or fish oil replacement in the fish diet. The review succinctly compares the composition of the insects with the requirements of the fish (proteins and amino acids, lipids and fatty acids, vitamins and minerals). This review also discusses the potential hurdles of using insects in fish feeds (toxicity of insects through bioaccumulation, deficiencies in amino acids or fatty acids, chitin content, palatability, digestibility), a nd the available ways of avoiding these drawbacks (control of the dietary substrate of insects in mass rearing units, manipulation of the diet of insects, mixture of dietary proteins, use of aquatic insects, processing of insect meal). Finally, it suggests paths worthy of future research on these new fishmeal alternatives.},

Males had much larger home ranges than females, but only males reduced their ranges significantly in the dry season. Home ranges overlapped a little between individuals, but their core areas were not overlapped suggesting territoriality. Taiwanese leopard cats in our study area tended to avoid large artificial open areas like agriculture land and man-made construction. Movement analyses showed that males were more mobile than females, but females used their home range in a more concentrated manner. They were nocturnal and exhibited crepuscular activity patterns in the wet season, but were arrhythmic in the dry season. Nocturnal activity was low during the dry season. We found 100{\%} mortality of radio-tagged individuals due to anthropogenic reasons within one y...},

abstract = {The foraging ecology of seven Gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua , breeding at Ardley Island, Antarctica was studied using animal-attached devices which recorded swimming speed, heading and dive depth. Reconstruction of the foraging routes by vectorial analysis of the data indicated that at no time did the birds forage on the sea bed. Swimming speed was relatively constant at 1.7 m s -1 , but rates of descent and ascent in the water column during dives increased with increasing maximum dive depth due to changes in descent and ascent angles. The amount of time spent discending and ascending in the water column increased with maximum dive depth as did the duration spent at the point of maximum depth. Dive profiles were essentially either U-shaped (flat-bottomed dives), or V-shaped (bounce dives). Development of a model based on simple probability theory indicated that the optimal dive profile to maximize the chances of prey acquisition depends on vertical prey distribution and on the visual capabilities of the birds with respect to descent and ascent angles.},

abstract = {Dogs (Canis familiaris) are considered one of the most numerous carnivores worldwide. Although in the Global North dogs are popular companions, that live inside homes, about 80{\%} of the dogs in the world are village dogs. At present, village dogs in the Global South are a concern for (inter)national organizations and individuals, such as tourists. Concerns arise about: overpopulation, transmission of zoonoses, welfare of village dogs, and issues relating to dog-wildlife interactions, such as predation on wildlife. Dog culling has proved ineffective in managing dog populations, in controlling zoonoses, and preventing wildlife predation, but remains the dominant strategy to manage village dogs in Mexico. The objective of this thesis was to improve the understanding of human-dog interactions in coastal areas of Mexico in order to identify strategies - embedded in the social and cultural context - to manage village dogs. The Pacific Coast of Mexico was used as a case study area because of its high dog density and its importance for tourism and sea-turtle nesting. Village dogs interact with tourists and are known to scavenge sea-turtle nests. Conclusions presented are based on fieldwork conducted in three villages in Oaxaca and two in Michoac{\'{a}}n. This fieldwork comprised, among others, interviews with villagers, dog behavioral tests, and radio-tracking of village dogs. Village dogs that live nearby nature protected areas are part of three main systems: the household, the village, and the nature protected area. Humans keep dogs mainly for guarding, as work companions and as children's playmates. At household level, dogs interact with familiar (i.e. caregivers) and unfamiliar humans (e.g. visitors). At village level, dogs interact with familiar humans from other households, or with unfamiliar humans, such as tourists. At all system levels, village dogs have experiences with humans that may range from positive to negative, and this may be reflected in their behavioral responses towards humans. Dogs reported to engage in human-dog play (mainly with children) were more likely to respond with tail wagging to a caregiver's call and to approach an unfamiliar human. Dogs can enter a nature protected area (i.e. sea-turtle nesting beach) by themselves or with other dogs or humans. Food is a central element in the above-described holistic system. Village dogs scavenge for food in proximity to humans, beg for food, or prey on sea-turtle eggs. Body condition of village dogs was in general close to optimal, and dogs maintained body condition also in the low season for sea-turtle nesting and tourism. Nest scavenger dogs, however, had a lower metabolic energy intake of tortillas, and a larger mean distance from home compared to non-nest scavengers. This suggests that nest scavenging is hunger-driven, and therefore, solutions need to focus on caregivers' feeding practices. The keeping of dogs in the above-described system, is subject to clashing perceptions and discourses of external (e.g. tourists, authorities) and internal (villagers) stakeholders. External stakeholders refer to village dogs as stray or abandoned, and any dog that is not totally dependent on humans (e.g. village dog) is considered out of place. Total dependence of dogs on humans is a logical ethical argument deriving from the idea that humans took dogs out of the wild. Villagers' narratives, in contrast, perceive dogs as autonomous and able to take care of themselves (in line with the Village Dog theory of dog self-domestication). Dog welfare problems (i.e. dogs being too thin or sick) in coastal Oaxaca were perceived more by international than by Mexican tourists. Dog predation of sea-turtle nests was an important concern for tourists, but not for internal stakeholders.},

abstract = {Aim Predators often have important roles in structuring ecosystems via their effects on each other and on prey populations.However, these effectsmay be altered in the presence of anthropogenic food resources, fuelling debate about whether the availability of such resources could alter the ecological role of predators. Here, we review the extent to which human-provided foods are utilised by terrestrial mam- malian predators ({\textgreater} 1 kg) across the globe.We also assess whether these resources have a direct impact on the ecology and behaviour of predators and an indirect impact on other co-occurring species. Location Global. Methods Data were derived from searches of the published literature. To sum- marise the data we grouped studies based on the direct and indirect effects of resource subsidies on predators and co-occurring species.We then compared the types of predators accessing these resources by grouping species taxonomically and into the following categories: (1) domesticated species, (2) mesopredators and (3) top predators. Results Human-provided foods were reported to be utilised by 36 terrestrial predator species in 34 different countries. In the presence of these resources we found that: (1) predator abundance increased, (2) the dietary preferences of preda- tors altered to include the food subsidy, (3) life-history parameters such as survival, reproduction and sociality shifted to the benefit or detriment of the predator, and (4) predators changed their home ranges, activity and movements. In some instances, these modifications indirectly affected co-occurring species via increased predation or competition. Main conclusions The availability of human-provided food to predators often results in behavioural or population-induced changes to predators and trophic cascades.We conclude that there is an urgent need to reduce the access of predators to food subsidies to minimise human–wildlife conflicts and to preserve the integ- rity of ecosystem functioning in human-influenced landscapes world-wide.},

abstract = {The establishment and reinforcement of dominance status is thought to provide an individual with increased access to preferred resources, such as food, mates, and shelter. Resources within an environment vary based on their availability, abundance, and specific characteristics of the resource. Animals can exhibit preferences for resources by increasing the intensity of competition for access to the resource. We investigated the role that dominance has in acquiring and controlling resources within crayfish populations. Populations of 5 size-matched crayfish were allowed to establish a social hierarchy in the presence of shelters of differing structure in 10 different trials. Crayfish agonistic interactions and the use and control of shelters were quantified from 96 h continuous video recordings. Shelter preference was defined by crayfish use of specific shelter types that were occupied for longer durations. Analysis of the social hierarchy demonstrated that crayfish have a linearity hierarchy in this context. In addition, it is clear that dominance rank had a significant impact on shelter use, shelter acquisition, and shelter eviction. Crayfish with lower average dominance ranks selected specific shelter types (smaller and fewer openings). Dominant crayfish used big shelters and were less likely to be evicted from shelters. These results demonstrate that dominance in crayfish serves a role in the acquisition of resources and is also important for the control of those resources.},

abstract = {Many wildlife species are managed based on the compensatory mortality hypothesis, which predicts that harvest mortality (especially adult male mortality) will trigger density-dependent responses in reproduction, survival, and population growth caused via reduced competition for resources. We tested the compensatory mortality hypothesis on two cougar (Puma concolor) populations in Washington, USA (one heavily hunted and one lightly hunted). We estimated population growth, density, survival, and reproduction to determine the effects of hunting on cougar population demography based on data collected from 2002 to 2007. In the heavily hunted population, the total hunting mortality rate (mean +/- SD) was 0.24 +/- 0.05 (0.35 +/- 0.08 for males, 0.16 +/- 0.05 for females). In the lightly hunted population, the total hunting mortality rate was 0.11 +/- 0.04 (0.16 +/- 0.06 for males, 0.07 +/- 0.05 for females). The compensatory mortality hypothesis predicts that higher mortality will result in higher maternity, kitten survival, reproductive success, and lower natural mortality. We found no differences in rates of maternity or natural mortality between study areas, and kitten survival was lower in the heavily hunted population. We rejected the compensatory mortality hypothesis because vital rates did not compensate for hunting mortality. Heavy harvest corresponded with increased immigration, reduced kitten survival, reduced female population growth, and a younger overall age structure. Light harvest corresponded with increased emigration, higher kitten survival, increased female population growth, and an older overall age structure. Managers should not assume the existence of compensatory mortality when developing harvest prescriptions for cougars.},

abstract = {Invasive mammalian predators are linked to terrestrial vertebrate extinctions worldwide. Prey na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} may explain the large impact invasive predators have on native prey; prey may fail to detect and react appropriately to the cues of novel predators, which results in high levels of depredation. In Australia, the feral cat ( Felis catus ) and the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) are implicated in more than 30 animal extinctions and the na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} of native prey is often used to explain this high extinction rate. Reptiles are one group of animals that are heavily preyed upon by F. catus and V. vulpes . However, very few studies have examined whether reptiles are naive to their cues. In this study, we examine the ability of two native reptile species ( Morethia boulengeri and Christinus marmoratus ) to detect and distinguish between the chemical cues of two invasive predators ( V. vulpes and F. catus ) and three native predators (spotted-tailed quoll, Dasyurus maculatus; dingo, Canis lupus dingo ; eastern brown snake, Pseudonaja textilis ), as well as two non-predator controls (eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus and water). We conducted experiments to quantify the effects of predator scents on lizard foraging (the amount of food eaten) during 1 h trials within Y-maze arenas. We found both study species reduced the amount they consumed when exposed to predator scents—both native and invasive—indicating that these species are not naive to invasive predators. An evolved generalized predator-recognition system, rapid evolution or learned behaviour could each explain the lack of na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} in some native Australian reptiles towards invasive predators.},

abstract = {Beginning January 2012, a humane method of dog population management using a Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (CNVR) program was implemented in Dhaka City, Bangladesh as part of the national rabies control program. To enable this program, the size and distribution of the free-roaming dog population needed to be estimated. We present the results of a dog population survey and a pilot assessment of the CNVR program coverage in Dhaka City. Free-roaming dog population surveys were undertaken in 18 wards of Dhaka City on consecutive days using mark-resight methods. Data was analyzed using Lincoln-Petersen index-Chapman correction methods. The CNVR program was assessed over the two years (2012–2013) whilst the coverage of the CNVR program was assessed by estimating the proportion of dogs that were ear-notched (processed dogs) via dog population surveys. The free-roaming dog population was estimated to be 1,242 (95 {\%} CI: 1205–1278) in the 18 sampled wards and 18,585 dogs in Dhaka City (52 dogs/km2) with an estimated human-to-free-roaming dog ratio of 828:1. During the two year CNVR program, a total of 6,665 dogs (3,357 male and 3,308 female) were neutered and vaccinated against rabies in 29 of the 92 city wards. A pilot population survey indicated a mean CNVR coverage of 60.6{\%} (range 19.2–79.3{\%}) with only eight wards achieving {\textgreater} 70{\%} coverage. Given that the coverage in many neighborhoods was below the WHO-recommended threshold level of 70{\%} for rabies eradications and since the CNVR program takes considerable time to implement throughout the entire Dhaka City area, a mass dog vaccination program in the non-CNVR coverage area is recommended to create herd immunity. The findings from this study are expected to guide dog population management and the rabies control program in Dhaka City and elsewhere in Bangladesh.},

Computer-modified videos were constructed to determine the relative importance of a static trait, the presence or absence of carotenoid pigment (C and NC), and a dynamic trait, high and low display rate (HD and LD), on female response. Females were given a choice between all combinations of male display and color in a binary choice design. Preference was determined by the time females spent visually inspecting the animation. Females preferred animations with high display rates when both animations displayed color (CHD vs CLD), but not in the absence of color (NCHD vs NCLD). Equal numbers of females chose the color/low-display animation and the no-color/high-display animation when the two were paired. Conversely, color became a criterion of choice when both animations showed a low display rate (CLD vs NCLD), but not when both displayed at a high rate (CHD vs NCHD). These results suggest that females use both static and dynamic traits to evaluate males, but their rankings are affected by the choices available. Results of these experiments provide insights into how females use multiple traits to assess males.},

abstract = {Among extant reptiles only two lineages are known to have evolved venom delivery systems, the advanced snakes and helodermatid lizards (Gila Monster and Beaded Lizard). Evolution of the venom system is thought to underlie the impressive radiation of the advanced snakes (2,500 of 3,000 snake species). In contrast, the lizard venom system is thought to be restricted to just two species and to have evolved independently from the snake venom system. Here we report the presence of venom toxins in two additional lizard lineages (Monitor Lizards and Iguania) and show that all lineages possessing toxin-secreting oral glands form a clade, demonstrating a single early origin of the venom system in lizards and snakes. Construction of gland complementary-DNA libraries and phylogenetic analysis of transcripts revealed that nine toxin types are shared between lizards and snakes. Toxinological analyses of venom components from the Lace Monitor Varanus varius showed potent effects on blood pressure and clotting ability, bioactivities associated with a rapid loss of consciousness and extensive bleeding in prey. The iguanian lizard Pogona barbata retains characteristics of the ancestral venom system, namely serial, lobular non-compound venom-secreting glands on both the upper and lower jaws, whereas the advanced snakes and anguimorph lizards (including Monitor Lizards, Gila Monster and Beaded Lizard) have more derived venom systems characterized by the loss of the mandibular (lower) or maxillary (upper) glands. Demonstration that the snakes, iguanians and anguimorphs form a single clade provides overwhelming support for a single, early origin of the venom system in lizards and snakes. These results provide new insights into the evolution of the venom system in squamate reptiles and open new avenues for biomedical research and drug design using hitherto unexplored venom proteins.},

The imperative for an animal to meet these costs within the energetic constraints of the environment drives many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, yet has largely been overlooked in traditional ecological paradigms. The field of 'ecological energetics' is bringing comparative physiology out of the laboratory and, for the first time, is becoming broadly accessible to field ecologists addressing real-world questions at many spatial and temporal scales. In an era of unprecedented global environmental challenges, ecological energetics opens up the tantalising prospect of a more predictive, mechanistic understanding of the drivers of threatened species decline, delivering process-based modelling approaches to natural resource management. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we investigate thermal effects on feeding, digestion, and net energy intake for Melanoplus bivittatus, the two-striped grasshopper In the field, M, bivittatus maintained body temperatures (T-b's) between 32 degrees C and 38 degrees C throughout most of a sunny day, but T-b's dropped to 0 degrees -15 degrees C at night. The threshold T-b for feeding in the field was 25 degrees C but was 15 degrees C when grasshoppers were kept without food for 12 h at 35 degrees C. Variables determined by the ability of the digestive tract to process food (food intake and fecal production per 8 h) were more temperature sensitive (Q(10)'s of 4-5) than variables reflecting chewing and crop- filling rates (Q(10)'s of 2-2.5). Higher T-b strongly increases net energy intake primarily by increasing digestive tract throughput in M. bivittatus, augmenting rates of individual development opment, and population expansion. The grasshopper's digestive system was essentially nonfunctional during half of its normal day in the field, implying that adaptation to high T-b's constrains digestive function at low T-b's.},

abstract = {To date there have been few opportunities to study the behavioral development of captive juvenile chimpanzess (Pan troglodytes) in species-appropriate groups. This study documents the social development of 21 (13 female, eight male) captive chimpanzees who were born into complex breeding groups and remained in this natal setting untial sexual maturity. Young males displayed the highest levels of sexual behavior, whereas females of all ages showed consistently lower levels than males. Older males showed the most aggression, with females again displaying consistently lower levels than males. Submission increased with age for both males and females. Males showed higher levels of affiliation than did females, but this difference was only slight at older ages. As all subjects matured they showed higher levels of grooming and lower levels of tandem walk/embrace. Social and solitary play declined over age for all subjects; males showed higher levels of social play than females at all ages. For aggression, social and solitary play, tandem walk/embrace, and grooming, the above results corroborate published findings from both studies of wild and captive chimpanzees. For sexual behavior and submission, these results most closely resemble those from studies on free-ranging chimpanzees. The behavioral similarity of the subjects of the current study to free-ranging chimpanzees may reflect the greater capacity of the rearing environment examined to promote species-typical social development in captive chimpanzees as compared with environments which have been previously examined in the literature.},

The introduced North American crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus Dana, is expanding its range in Europe and locally often replaces two native crayfish species, Astacus astacus L. and Austropotamobius pallipes Lereboullet. Pacifastacus leniusculus is also expected to invade the habitat of a third native crayfish, the endangered Austropotamobius torrentium Schrank.  Interspecific aggressive interactions and competition for shelter were experimentally studied in the laboratory to assess the potential impact of P. leniusculus on A. torrentium.  2. Neither species was inherently dominant in aggressive interactions, but dominance was strongly size-dependent, favouring the larger and faster growing species, P. leniusculus.  3. Access to limited shelter was generally determined by aggressive dominance, although species-specific preference also influenced the outcome of competition for shelter. Austropotamobius torrentium had a higher preference for experimental shelters and often defended these even against larger P. leniusculus.  4. In accordance with theoretical models of animal conflicts, agonistic interactions between equally sized contestants were more severe than between animals of different size.  5. The P. leniusculus used in the present experiment were infected with the crayfish plague, Aphanomyces astaci, to which the animals are resistant.

abstract = {Agricultural farming is a major consumer of global arable lands and has a direct effect on species decline through habitat destruction. However, agricultural endeavours can also evoke indirect threats that will result in behavioural modifications of indigenous species. In a desert ecosystem, where a political border led to a farming dichotomy between intensive cultivates in Israel and intact lands in Jordan, we compared the foraging behaviours and abundances of the red fox and two species of gerbils, close to and distant from farms, and during two moon phases. We estimated fox and gerbil foraging levels by track counts, and measured gerbil time allocation, vigilance and apprehension by the giving-up density method. While foxes were significantly more abundant and active at locations close to farms, gerbils were significantly more abundant and active at locations distant from farms. Moreover, the typical reduction in food consumption during full-moon nights was exhibited only at locations close to farms. These results could suggest that indicators of predation risk, such as illumination intensity or distance to cover, are not universal, and their effectiveness may depend indirectly on anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural farming. The results could also suggest that although intensive agricultural endeavours benefit foxes, they might increase the predatory pressure on gerbils in addition to the already known effects of habitat loss. Therefore, agriculture acts as a double-edged sword by reducing natural habitats, while at the same time changing the predator–prey natural balance.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/zoo.10082.abs A variety of commercially raised insects are fed to insectivorous reptiles, but information concerning appropriate diets used to feed these insects is limited. In the present study, house crickets (Acheta domesticus adults and nymphs), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae), and silkworms (Bombyx mori larvae) were fed diets containing graded levels of calcium (Ca) and/or vitamin A–nutrients that are low or absent in most insects. Diets and insects were analyzed for moisture, Ca, phosphorus (P), and vitamin A. For adult crickets and cricket nymphs, body Ca and vitamin A concentrations increased in a linear fashion with increasing levels of dietary Ca or vitamin A. Ca concentrations of silkworms also increased in a linear fashion with increasing levels of dietary Ca. For mealworms, body Ca and vitamin A concentrations increased in a nonlinear fashion with increasing levels of dietary Ca or vitamin A. These regression equations, in conjunction with insect nutrient composition, allow for the calculation of the optimum nutrient concentration for gut-loading diets. Final recommendations were based on National Research Council (NRC) requirements for rats, adjustments for the energy content of the insects, and nutrient overages as appropriate. Gut-loading diets for crickets (adults and nymphs) should be supplemented to contain the following nutrients, respectively: Ca (51 and 32 g/kg), vitamin A (8,310 and 5,270 µg retinol/kg), vitamin D (300 and 190 µg cholecalciferol/kg), vitamin E (140 and 140 mg RRR-$\alpha$-tocopherol/kg), thiamin (31 and 21 mg/kg), and pyridoxine (20 and 10 mg/kg). Gut-loading diets for mealworms should be supplemented to contain the following nutrients: Ca (90 g/kg), iron (51 mg/kg), manganese (31 mg/kg), vitamin A (13,310 µg retinol/kg), vitamin D (460 µg cholecalciferol/kg), vitamin E (660 mg RRR-$\alpha$-tocopherol/kg), thiamin (5 mg/kg), vitamin B12 (650 µg/kg), and methionine (29 g/kg). Gut-loading diets for silkworms should be supplemented to contain the following nutrients: Ca (23 g/kg), iodine (0.7 mg/kg), vitamin D (140 µg cholecalciferol/kg), vitamin E (70 mg RRR-$\alpha$-tocopherol/kg), and vitamin B12 (226 µg/kg).

abstract = {Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk{\aa}l) (Orthoptera: Acrididae), exhibit a population density-dependent phase polymorphism which includes the gradual change of many morphological, physiological and behavioural characteristics. Many volatiles associated with desert locusts have been identified recently and it is assumed that they are involved in pheromonal control of behaviour and development of locusts. Ovipositing females deposit with their egg pods several volatiles that appear to be attractive to other females resulting – possibly in combination with environmental factors – in an aggregated oviposition. Mature males release several volatiles, among them phenylacetonitrile, which are reported to accelerate sexual maturation in young males. Also, aggregation pheromone systems for hoppers and adults have been described. However, recent studies and publications shed a new light on the postulated effects of some of these volatiles. Gregarious behaviour can undoubtedly be induced by mechanical stimuli. Furthermore, the main component of the adult aggregation pheromone system, phenylacetonitrile, is found to be a repellent obviously not involved in aggregation. Comprehensive studies have demonstrated that phenylacetonitrile is used by mature gregarious males as a courtship inhibition pheromone to enhance mate guarding. Recent progress, contradictory results and perspectives in desert locust pheromone research related to reproduction are summarized and discussed in this paper.},

The study was conducted in a field and forest mosaic in the central part of the country in the years 2005–2011. The density of the free-ranging dogs was assessed during night counts along repeated transect routes. The num- ber of dogs seen and the feasible observation area were recorded to calculate density index for each control. The day and night counts captured data on group composition and penetration range. Di- ets were studied through scat analyses. The dog density ranged from 2.2–3.1 ind. km–2 depending on the area. Most dogs were observed alone, and 40{\%} formed groups of 2 to 5 dogs. Most groups were recorded close to buildings, but the group organisation changed (especially during the day- time) with increasing distance from the buildings: 35{\%} of dogs in the village were in groups, but 55{\%} of dogs formed groups at a distance of more than 100 m from the buildings. The night proportion of dogs in groups was approximately 50{\%}, regardless of the distance. Their scats contained mostly cere- al given by farmers. The prey remains were game species: roe deer (1.3{\%} of occurrences in summer and 12{\%} in winter), brown hare (3–4{\%}), small mammals (5–9.5{\%}) and birds (approx. 1.5{\%}). The study demonstrated that the abundance of dogs in the rural areas of central Poland may play an im- portant role in the ecosystem.},

Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.},

abstract = {Embryonic germ cells as well as germline stem cells from neonatal mouse testis are pluripotent and have differentiation potential similar to embryonic stem cells, suggesting that the germline lineage may retain the ability to generate pluripotent cells. However, until now there has been no evidence for the pluripotency and plasticity of adult spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which are responsible for maintaining spermatogenesis throughout life in the male. Here we show the isolation of SSCs from adult mouse testis using genetic selection, with a success rate of 27{\%}. These isolated SSCs respond to culture conditions and acquire embryonic stem cell properties. We name these cells multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSCs). They are able to spontaneously differentiate into derivatives of the three embryonic germ layers in vitro and generate teratomas in immunodeficient mice. When injected into an early blastocyst, SSCs contribute to the development of various organs and show germline transmission. Thus, the capacity to form multipotent cells persists in adult mouse testis. Establishment of human maGSCs from testicular biopsies may allow individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, these cells may provide new opportunities to study genetic diseases in various cell lineages.},

Here we test whether these correlates could create status-related differences in immune function by measuring the incidence of illness and injury and then examining healing rates in a 27-y data set of natural injuries and illnesses in wild baboon males. We found no evidence that the high testosterone and intense reproductive effort associated with high rank suppress immune responses. Instead, high-ranking males were less likely to become ill, and they recovered more quickly than low-ranking males, even controlling for differences in age. Notably, alpha males, who experience high glucocorticoids, as well as the highest testosterone and reproductive effort, healed significantly faster than other males, even other high-ranking males. We discuss why alpha males seem to escape from the immunosuppressive costs of glucocorticoids but low-ranking males do not, including the idea that glucocorticoids' effects depend on an individual's physiological and social context.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

We used grizzly bears ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Ursus arctos{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) from a threatened population in Canada and surface mining as a case study. RSF predictions based on GPS radiocollared bears (n {\textless}sub{\textgreater}during mining{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 7; n {\textless}sub{\textgreater}post mining{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 9) showed that males and solitary females selected areas primarily outside mineral surface leases (MSLs) during active mining, and conversely inside MSLs after mine closure. However, females with cubs selected areas within compared to outside MSLs irrespective of mining activity. Individual variability was pronounced, although some environmental- and human-related variables were consistent across reproductive classes. For males and solitary females, regional-scale RSFs yielded comparable results to site-specific models, whereas for females with cubs, modelling the two scales produced divergent results. While mine reclamation may afford opportunities for bear persistence, managing public access will likely decrease the risk of human-caused bear mortality. RSFs are powerful tools that merit widespread use in quantitative and visual investigations of wildlife habitat selection on industrially-modified landscapes, using Geographic Information System layers that precisely characterize site-specific conditions. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The development of GPS tags for tracking wildlife has revolutionised the study of home ranges, habitat use and behaviour. Concomitantly, there have been rapid developments in methods for estimating habitat use from GPS data. In combination, these changes can cause challenges in choosing the best methods for estimating home ranges. In primatology, this issue has received little attention, as there have been few GPS collar-based studies to date. However, as advancing technology is making collaring studies more feasible, there is a need for the analysis to advance alongside the technology. Here, using a high quality GPS collaring data set from 10 proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus), we aimed to: 1) compare home range estimates from the most commonly used method in primatology, the grid-cell method, with three recent methods designed for large and/or temporally correlated GPS data sets; 2) evaluate how well these methods identify known physical barriers (e.g. rivers); and 3) test the robustness of the different methods to data containing either less frequent or random losses of GPS fixes. Biased random bridges had the best overall performance, combining a high level of agreement between the raw data and estimated utilisation distribution with a relatively low sensitivity to reduced fixed frequency or loss of data. It estimated the home range of proboscis monkeys to be 24-165 ha (mean 80.89 ha). The grid-cell method and approaches based on local convex hulls had some advantages including simplicity and excellent barrier identification, respectively, but lower overall performance. With the most suitable model, or combination of models, it is possible to understand more fully the patterns, causes, and potential consequences that disturbances could have on an animal, and accordingly be used to assist in the management and restoration of degraded landscapes.},

The ratios of grass to dicot were similar in the diets determined by direct obervation and valve fistulation, but faecal analysis over-emphasized dicots relative to other techniques. The greatest overlap in estimated diet was between faecal analysis and valve fistulation. Overall the valve fistulation technique was considered superior to the other 2 techniques because it provided reliable estimates of diet composition that could be readily equated to range conditions at the time of ingestion.},

However, ecology is not the only discipline interested in movement: a number of information sciences are specialising in analysis and visualisation of movement data. The recent explosion in availability and complexity of movement data has resulted in a call in ecology for new appropriate methods that would be able to take full advantage of the increasingly complex and growing data volume. One way in which this could be done is to form interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and experts from information sciences that analyse movement. In this paper we present an overview of new movement analysis and visualisation methodologies resulting from such an interdisciplinary research network: the European COST Action "MOVE - Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects" (http://www.move-cost.info). This international network evolved over four years and brought together some 140 researchers from different disciplines: those that collect movement data (out of which the movement ecology was the largest represented group) and those that specialise in developing methods for analysis and visualisation of such data (represented in MOVE by computational geometry, geographic information science, visualisation and visual analytics). We present MOVE achievements and at the same time put them in ecological context by exploring relevant ecological themes to which MOVE studies do or potentially could contribute.},

An unintended conse- quence is the strong modulation of the three- way interaction involving people, predators and prey, a dynamic that questions the extent to which animal distributions and interactions are independent of subtle human influences. Here, I capitalize on the remarkable 9-day synchronicity in which 90{\%} of moose neonates in the Yellow- stoneEcosystem areborn, to demonstratea substantive change in how prey avoid predators; birth sites shift away from traffic-averse brown bears and towards paved roads. The decade- long modification was associated with carnivore recolonization, but neither mothers in bear-free areas nor non-parous females altered patterns of landscape use. These findings offer rigorous support that mammals use humans to shield against carnivores and raise the possibility that redistribution has occurred in other mammalian taxa due to human presence in ways we have yet to anticipate. To interpret ecologically function- ing systems within parks, we must now also account for indirect anthropogenic effects on species distributions and behaviour.},

abstract = {Large-bodied mammalian herbivores dominated Earth's terrestrial ecosystems for several million years before undergoing substantial extinctions and declines during the Late Pleistocene (LP) due to prehistoric human impacts. The decline of large herbivores led to widespread ecological changes due to the loss of their ecological functions, as driven by their unique combinations of traits. However, recently, humans have significantly increased herbivore species richness through introductions in many parts of the world, potentially counteracting LP losses. Here, we assessed the extent to which introduced herbivore species restore lost—or contribute novel—functions relative to preextinction LP assemblages. We constructed multidimensional trait spaces using a trait database for all extant and extinct mammalian herbivores ≥10 kg known from the earliest LP (∼130,000 ybp) to the present day. Extinction-driven contractions of LP trait space have been offset through introductions by ∼39{\%} globally. Analysis of trait space overlap reveals that assemblages with introduced species are overall more similar to those of the LP than native-only assemblages. This is because 64{\%} of introduced species are more similar to extinct rather than extant species within their respective continents. Many introduced herbivores restore trait combinations that have the capacity to influence ecosystem processes, such as wildfire and shrub expansion in drylands. Although introduced species have long been a source of contention, our findings indicate that they may, in part, restore ecological functions reflective of the past several million years before widespread human-driven extinctions.},

We review analytical methods for dealing with correlated data in the context of resource selection, including post hoc variance inflation techniques, 'two-stage' approaches based on models fit to each individual, generalized estimating equations and hierarchical mixed-effects models. These methods are applicable to a wide range of correlated data problems, but can be difficult to apply and remain especially challenging for use-availability sampling designs because the correlation structure for combinations of used and available points are not likely to follow common parametric forms. We also review emerging approaches to studying habitat selection that use fine-scale temporal data to arrive at biologically based definitions of available habitat, while naturally accounting for autocorrelation by modelling animal movement between telemetry locations. Sophisticated analyses that explicitly model correlation rather than consider it a nuisance, like mixed effects and state-space models, offer potentially novel insights into the process of resource selection, but additional work is needed to make them more generally applicable to large datasets based on the use-availability designs. Until then, variance inflation techniques and two-stage approaches should offer pragmatic and flexible approaches to modelling correlated data.},

abstract = {Desert locust Schistocerca gregaria outbreaks consistently start in the same places, suggesting that certain landscapes are particularly favourable for outbreaking. Outbreaks are generated by multiplication, concentration and gregarisation of locust populations. Previous research has shown how small-scale vegetation patterns in desert ecosystems influence locust gregarisation; the present study examines the effects of large-scale landscape structure on locust multiplication and concentration. NOAA/ AVHRR satellite imagery was used to relate abundance and spatial distribution of resources at the landscape scale to the historical record of locust outbreaks. Threshold NDVI values were investigated to define what constitutes ‘resource' for locusts. The first part of the study showed that abundance and spatial distribution of resource were not sufficient to distinguish between outbreak and non-outbreak areas in the western part of the locust distribution area. Thus, outbreak danger zones cannot be identified by landscape structure at this spatial resolution. The second analysis investigated spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation growth in two locust breeding areas with very different landscape structure; in both cases, the patterns differed significantly between outbreaking and non-outbreaking years. In Mauritania, a flat homogeneous desert landscape, both resource abundance and fragmentation were higher in outbreaking years. On the Red Sea coast, a fragmented landscape, resource spatial distribution was consistent between years, and abundance alone was a significant predictor of outbreaking. High resource abundance promotes locustmultiplication, and contraction of resource into small patches increases locust concentration; these two mechanisms explain how landscape structure influences locust outbreaking.},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivore populations are often intensively managed, either because the carnivore in question is endangered, or because it is viewed as a pest and is subjected to control measures, or both. Most management programmes treat carnivore species in isolation. However, there is a large and emerging body of evidence to demonstrate that populations of different carnivores interact with each other in a variety of complex ways. Thus, the removal or introduction of predators to or from a system can often affect other species in ways that are difficult to predict. Wildlife managers must consider such interactions when planning predator control pro- grammes. Integrated predator control will require a greater understanding of the complex relationships between species. In many parts of the world, sympatric species of carnivores have coexisted over an evolutionary time scale so that niche differentiation has occurred, and competition is difficult to observe. Australia has experienced nu- merous introductions during the past 200 years, including those of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the feral cat (Felis catus). These species now exist in sympatry with native mammalian predators, providing ecologists with the opportunity to study their interactions without the confounding effects of coevolution. Despite an increasing body of observational evidence for complex interactions among native and introduced predators in Australia, few studies have attempted to clarify these relationships experimentally, and the interac- tions remain largely unacknowledged. A greater understanding of these interactions would provide ecologists and wildlife managers world-wide with the ability to construct robust predictive models of carnivore communities, and to identify their broader effects on ecosystem functioning. We suggest that future research should focus on controlled and replicated predator removal or addition experiments. The dingo (Canis lupus dingo), as a likely keystone species, should be a particular focus of attention.},

In each enclosure we estimated the 3 indices on 30 randomly located 150-m transects, with each transect having 30 circular plots of 3.14 m2. We developed 4 candidate models (1 linear and 3 nonlinear) to describe the relationship between the indices and deer density. We used a Bayesian analysis to account for uncertainty in the estimates of deer abundance and to facilitate fitting models that included random transect effects. The 4 models explained the relationship between the 3 indices and deer density similarly well. The slopes of the linear relationships between the 3 indices and deer density were positive. Our results suggest that fecal pellet counts may be useful indices of deer abundance.},

Home ranges of resident coyotes were mutually exclusive, whereas those of transient coyotes overlapped the home ranges of other coyotes. Excursions from home ranges were made by all resident pack associates but not by resident breeders. Grassland habitats were used more than expected by resident coyotes but less than expected by transients. Woodlands and cultivated lands were used more than expected by transients. Transient coyotes used areas between the home ranges of resident family groups. Annual survival rates were higher for resident than for transient coyotes. Avoidance of resident coyotes by transient coyotes may explain differences in space and habitat use by coyotes.},

abstract = {Many captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are subjectively considered to be overweight or obese. However, discussions of obesity in chimpanzees are rare in the literature, despite the acknowledged problem. No study to date has systematically examined obesity in captive chimpanzees. This project develops guidelines for defining obesity in captive chimpanzees through the examination of morphometric and physiologic characteristics in 37 adult female and 22 adult male chimpanzees. During each animal's biannual physical exam, morphometric data was collected including seven skinfolds (mm), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and total body weight (kg). The morphometric characteristics were correlated with triglycerides and serum glucose concentration, to test the utility of morphometrics in predicting relative obesity in captive chimpanzees. Abdominal skinfold (triglyceride: F=3.83, P=0.05; glucose: F=3.83, P=0.05) and BMI (triglyceride: F=10.42, p=0.003; glucose: F=6.20, P=0.02) were predictive of increased triglycerides and serum glucose in females; however no morphometric characteristics were predictive of relative obesity in males. Results suggest that no males in this population are overweight or obese. For females, there were additional significant differences in morphometric (skinfolds, BMI, WHR, total body weight) and physiologic measurements (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, red blood cells) between individuals classified overweight and those classified non-overweight. Skinfold measurements, particularly abdominal, seem to be an accurate measure of obesity and thus potential cardiovascular risk in female chimpanzees, but not males. By establishing a baseline for estimated body fat composition in female captive chimpanzees, institutions can track individuals empirically determined to be obese, as well as obesity-related health problems.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Animal traditions can affect survival by improv-ing how individuals use their environment. They are inherited through social learning and are restricted to small subpopulations. As a result, traditions are rare and their preservation needs to be considered in biodiversity conservation. We studied Burmese long-tailed macaques Macaca fascicularis aurea living on Piak Nam Yai Island in Laem Son National Park, Thailand, which maintain a rare stone tool-using tradition for processing hard-shelled invertebrate prey along the island's shores. We found the population had 192 individuals in nine groups and most individuals used stone tools. This population is under pressure from the local human community through the development of farms and release of domestic dogs Canis familiaris onto the island. The level of anthropogenic impact varied in each macaque groups' range and juvenile– infant composition varied with impact. The proportion of young was smaller in groups overlapping farms and was negatively correlated with the amount of dog activity in their range. We also found that coastal use by macaques was negatively related to living near plantations and that the dogs displaced macaques from the shores in 93{\%} of their encounters. We conclude that human impact is negatively affecting Piak Nam Yai's macaques and are concerned this could disrupt the persistence of their stone-use tradition. we discuss the impact and the potential consequences, and we recommend better protection of coastal areas within Laem Son National Park.},

abstract = {Venom is a key innovation underlying the evolution of advanced snakes (Caenophidia). Despite this, very little is known about venom system structural diversification, toxin recruitment event timings, or toxin molecular evolution. A multidisciplinary approach was used to examine the diversification of the venom system and associated toxins across the full range of the approximately 100 million-year-old advanced snake clade with a particular emphasis upon families that have not secondarily evolved a front-fanged venom system ( approximately 80{\%} of the 2500 species). Analysis of cDNA libraries revealed complex venom transcriptomes containing multiple toxin types including three finger toxins, cobra venom factor, cysteine-rich secretory protein, hyaluronidase, kallikrein, kunitz, lectin, matrix metalloprotease, phospholipase A(2), snake venom metalloprotease/a disintegrin and metalloprotease, and waprin. High levels of sequence diversity were observed, including mutations in structural and functional residues, changes in cysteine spacing, and major deletions/truncations. Morphological analysis comprising gross dissection, histology, and magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated extensive modification of the venom system architecture in non-front-fanged snakes in contrast to the conserved structure of the venom system within the independently evolved front-fanged elapid or viperid snakes. Further, a reduction in the size and complexity of the venom system was observed in species in which constriction has been secondarily evolved as the preferred method of prey capture or dietary preference has switched from live prey to eggs or to slugs/snails. Investigation of the timing of toxin recruitment events across the entire advanced snake radiation indicates that the evolution of advanced venom systems in three front-fanged lineages is associated with recruitment of new toxin types or explosive diversification of existing toxin types. These results support the role of venom as a key evolutionary innovation in the diversification of advanced snakes and identify a potential role for non-front-fanged venom toxins as a rich source for lead compounds for drug design and development.},

In these times of regional and global species declines, we are challenged with the task of causally linking knowledge about the molecular actions of pesticides to their possible interference with biological processes, in order to develop reliable predictions about the consequences of pesticide use, and misuse, in a rapidly changing world.},

abstract = {Ecotourism involving feeding wildlife has raised public attention and is a controversial issue, especially concerning nonhuman primates. Between July 2002 and April 2005, the behavior of monkeys and tourists was collected through scan samplings, focal samplings and behavior samplings at the Shou-Shan Nature Park located in Taiwan's second largest city--Kaohsiung. In addition, the number of tourists and monkeys was counted in different hours and places within the park. Four hundred visitors were interviewed using a questionnaire to gather data on sex, age, purpose and frequency of visit to the park. The number of tourists was significantly higher during weekends than in weekdays in all locations. Humans dominated in the initiation of interspecies interactions--the overall ratio of human-initiated and monkey-initiated interactions was 2.44:1. Human-monkey conflicts accounted for only 16.4{\%} of the total interactions (n=2,166), and adult human males and adult male macaques participated in higher rates than other age/sex groups in these conflicts. Visitors showed more affiliative behavior (15.9{\%}) than agonistic behavior (8{\%}) toward the macaques. In response to visitors' threat or attack, the Formosan macaques mostly showed submissive behavior with bared teeth, squealed or ran away to avoid confrontation (69.1{\%})--only few responded with counteraggression (18.7{\%}). This study for the first time provided evidence that food provisioning increased both the frequency and duration of aggression among Formosan macaques (P{\textless}0.001). During food provisioning, the average frequency and the duration of agonistic events of macaques were more than 4 times higher compared with those without food provisioning. The average frequency of food provision by tourists was 0.73 times/hr--more than twice the incident that monkeys grabbed the food from tourists (0.34 times/hr). If people refrain from feeding monkeys and destroying the city park's natural vegetation, monkeys can be used to educate public about nature conservation in an urban setting.},

abstract = {Characterizing patterns of observed current variation, and testing hypotheses concerning the potential drivers of this variation, is fundamental to understanding how morphology evolves. Phylogenetic history, size and ecology are all central components driving the evolution of morphological variation, but only recently have methods become available to tease these aspects apart for particular body structures. Extant monitor lizards (Varanus) have radiated into an incredible range of habitats and display the largest body size range of any terrestrial vertebrate genus. Although their body morphology remains remarkably conservative, they have obvious head shape variation. We use two-dimensional geometric morphometric techniques to characterize the patterns of dorsal head shape variation in 36 species (375 specimens) of varanid, and test how this variation relates to size, phylogenetic history and ecology as represented by habitat. Interspecific head shape disparity is strongly allometric. Once size effects are removed, principal component analysis shows that most shape variation relates to changes in the snout and head width. Size-corrected head shape variation has strong phylogenetic signal at a broad level, but habitat use is predictive of shape disparity within phylogenetic lineages. Size often explains shape disparity among organisms; however, the ability to separate size and shape variation using geometric morphometrics has enabled the identification of phylogenetic history and habitat as additional key factors contributing to the evolution of head shape disparity among varanid lizards.},

abstract = {The conversion of natural habitats to croplands is a major cause of the global loss of species diversity and ecosystem services. One potentially effective method for enhancing the biodiversity of important groups such as insects, and their associated ecosystem services within croplands, is to increase the environmental complexity of the agricultural matrix. This can be achieved in perennial tree crops by planting mixed-age stands. There is, however, very little evidence for the effects of stand age on biodiversity in tropical tree crops. In this study, we assess how ground-foraging ant communities differ in relation to oil palm stand age, currently the dominant tree crop across tropical Southeast Asia. Oil palm age did not affect overall ant species richness. However, the numbers of species that were either common or numerically-dominant decreased with increases in canopy cover, which positively correlated with oil palm age, suggesting greater species evenness in older oil palm. In mature, but not young, oil palm, ant species co-occurred non-randomly, suggesting competitive exclusion and species segregation. Species responses to variables associated with oil palm age depended on their functional group. Generally, opportunists and generalized myrmicines were less abundant and less diverse, whereas specialist predators were more abundant and diverse, in older oil palm. Our results show that ground-foraging ant communities in oil palm change significantly in composition, but not in species richness, with crop age. These results suggest that mixed-age stands could support compositionally variable communities and help boost insect diversity in otherwise homogeneous perennial monocultures.},

Choosing an appropriate satellite tracking system for a project involves financial, technical and operational tradeoffs associated with different systems. Aim. The aim of the present research was to assess the technology options and associated costs to help wildlife researchers select the best tracking solution for their needs. Methods. A technology-choice decision guide was developed to assist wildlife scientists select an optimal tracking technology. We undertook four satellite tracking case studies involving avian, aquatic and terrestrial species living in diverse environments around the world and use these case studies to validate and test the technology-choice decision guide and to calculate the cost effectiveness of alternative tracking methods. Technologies used in marine tracking were out of the scope of the present paper. Key results. Choosing the tracking method best suited for a project requires (1) clearly specifying the data required to meet project objectives, (2) understanding the constraints imposed by the study species and its environment, and (3) calculating the net cost per datum of the various tracking methods available. Key conclusions. We suggest that, in most circumstances, global positioning system (GPS) tracking is preferable to other options. However, where weight and environmental limitations prevent the use of GPS, alternatives such as Argos satellite Doppler-based positions (Argos) or very high frequency (VHF) can function adequately. Implications. The present paper provides simplified criteria for selecting the best wildlife satellite tracking technology for different situations.},

This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories.

The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a widespread pest in southern Australia and is subject to control over large areas using poison baits to protect both agricultural and ecological assets. Foxes and their prey are often cryptic or in low densities, making it difficult to quantify the efficacy of control programs. Aims. We explore the use of remote cameras to estimate the activity and spatial occupancy of foxes and potential mammalian and avian prey species before and after poison baiting in the Goonoo region, central New South Wales. Methods. In the first of two studies, we set camera traps at 48 sites in forest and cleared areas, on and off tracks, during autumn 2009. In the second study, we placed camera traps in forest and cleared areas, on tracks only, at 100 sites covering an area of {\~{}}441 500 ha during winter 2009. We examined camera-trap rates of all species detected and the activity and site occupancy of a selected subset of species before and after poison baiting. Key results. Camera traps indicated greater levels of fox activity on vehicular tracks than off them, with this difference being more marked in forest than in cleared agricultural land. Fox activity and occupancy were greater in agricultural land than in forest, with no effect of baiting detected at the landscape scale. Thirty-five other mammal and bird species were identified from photos, with activity for most being greater on than off tracks. Conclusions. No clear effects of fox-baiting were detected on foxes or potential prey species in either study by either activity or occupancy. The lack of a baiting effect may reflect rapid recolonisation by foxes from unbaited areas, as bait placement is generally clustered in agricultural land, or the ready availability of alternative food (lambs or lamb carcasses) in some cleared areas. Implications. Our results demonstrate that remote cameras provide a simple means of monitoring changes in fox activity and occupancy at the landscape level, and that these measures have great potential to quantify the success or otherwise of fox- control campaigns on both pest and prey species.

abstract = {This paper aims to compile an exhaustive list of the behavioral patterns exhibited by the chimpanzees of the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. The compilation is based on the glossary compiled by Goodall (1989), but a substantial numbers of new terms have been added. Thus, we list 316 simple anatomical terms, 81 complex anatomical terms, 37 simple functional terms, and 81 complex functional terms, in addition to 116 synonyms. The behavioral patterns are divided into eight categories on the basis of degree of universality: (1) commonly seen in both Homo and two species of Pan, (1?) commonly seen in Homo and only one species of Pan, (2) patterns common to the genus Pan but not to Homo, (3) patterns common to the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes but not the bonobo Pan paniscus, (4) patterns common to eastern (P.t. schweinfurthii) and central (Pt.troglodytes) but not western (P.t.verus) chimpanzees, (5) patterns unique to the eastern chimpanzees, P.t.schweinfurthii, (6) patterns unique to the population of Mahale, (7) patterns unique to many individuals (at least most members of an age/sex class) of M group chimpanzees, (8) patterns limited to a single (idiosyncrasy) or a few individuals of M group.It is most likely that the behavior patterns of the last common ancestor of Homo and Pan are found in Categories 1 and 1? and less likely in Categories 2 and 3.It is possible that behavior patterns belonging to Categories 5, 6 or 7 are cultures.},

abstract = {In temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) species, offspring sex-ratio is dependent on the environmental temperature. For oviparous sauropsid species, temperature within the nest influences gonadal sexual differentiation during a small window of embryogenesis called the thermosensitive period (TSP). The absence of sexual dimorphic characteristic in juveniles of TSD species coupled with the lack of a non-invasive method to determine sex is a great obstacle to studies estimating sex-ratios under natural conditions. Some authors have proposed proxies of sex-ratio obtained through correlative approaches. They commonly extrapolate the empirical profile of sex-ratios as a function of constant incubation temperature established for several species in the laboratory to a field context. However, most of these proxies have been refuted by studies realized under field conditions, and consequently they cannot be used to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. Here, we propose a new thermal model of TSD using a mechanistic approach. We built this model from a collection of published data of physiological processes (i.e. the growth of the embryo, the growth of gonads and the activity of the enzyme aromatase) underlying the TSD mechanism, for the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). This new approach provides integration of incubation temperature fluctuations, as well as the cumulative and differential effect of high and low temperatures on sexual differentiation to embryo sex determination. The significant consistency obtained between observed and predicted sex-ratios both at diverse constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures provides hope to develop an efficient method to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. The reliable validity of this new model could have wide-ranging implications for the understanding of the TSD mechanism, as well as its evolutionary and ecological consequences in natural populations.},

abstract = {Mammals envenomed by either the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) or the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus) exhibit an immediate but transitory pupillar contraction, a parasympathomimetic effect mediated through the ciliary ganglion that can be prevented by a retrobulbar injection of anesthetic. The venom of the cottonmouth injected into the lymph spaces of the frog (Rana pipiens) produces an immediate and total collapse of the lung sacs. Applied locally to the surface, it produces a constriction that eventually collapses the entire sac. Tests of venoms and toxins from both anterior and posterior parts of the venom apparatus indicate that the lung-collapsing moiety originates in the accessory, not the main portion of the venom gland. This is the first example of a functional specialization within the whole structure. It seems that this factor is elaborated primarily in snakes that prey upon frogs, although insufficient data are available from this study to confirm this. In both reptile species, the predatory strike is accompanied by an immediate effect, perhaps mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system, designed to incapacitate the prey and facilitate capture. These effects cannot now be attributed to neurotoxins because the effect of the former is transitory (and not lethal) and neither has been purified sufficiently to determine potency or structure. Both take part in securing, but not killing, the prey, and both directly oppose the sympathetic nervous system "fright-fight/flight" response. Evidence is presented to support the possibility that known epigenetic mechanisms are capable of effecting heritable changes in gene expression that could allow for the development of factors that facilitate prey acquisition and promote rapid adaptation to environmental change.},

abstract = {Tame behaviour, i.e. low wariness, in terrestrial island species is often attributed to low predation pressure. However, we know little about its physiological control and its flexibility in the face of predator introductions. Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) on the Galapagos Islands are a good model to study the physiological correlates of low wariness. They have lived virtually without predation for 5-15 Myr until some populations were first confronted with feral cats and dogs some 150 years ago. We tested whether and to what extent marine iguanas can adjust their behaviour and endocrine stress response to novel predation threats. Here, we show that a corticosterone stress response to experimental chasing is absent in naive animals, but is quickly restored with experience. Initially, low wariness also increases with experience, but remains an order of magnitude too low to allow successful escape from introduced predators. Our data suggest that the ability of marine iguanas to cope with predator introductions is limited by narrow reaction norms for behavioural wariness rather than by constraints in the underlying physiological stress system. In general, we predict that island endemics show flexible physiological stress responses but are restricted by narrow behavioural plasticity.},

As the volume rises, traditional methods are giving way to machine learning and data science, which are playing an increasingly large part it turning this data into science-driving insights. One rich and interesting source is the bio-logger. These small electronic wearable devices are attached to animals free to roam in their natural habitats, and report back readings from multiple sensors, including GPS and accelerometer bursts. A common use of accelerometer data is for supervised learning of behavioral modes. However, we need unsupervised analysis tools as well, in order to overcome the inherent difficulties of obtaining a labeled dataset, which in some cases is either infeasible or does not successfully encompass the full repertoire of behavioral modes of interest. Here we present a matrix factorization based topic-model method for accelerometer bursts, derived using a linear mixture property of patch features. Our method is validated via comparison to a labeled dataset, and is further compared to standard clustering algorithms.},

Of 2190 monarch captures, 6 were previously tagged in other locations, allowing possible migration routes and rates of travel in varying wind conditions to be inferred. Monarchs reached our site fastest when they migrated with strong northerly winds. Only one monarch tagged at our study site was recovered at the overwintering site in Mexico. Compared to recovery rates from monarchs tagged in other locations in North America, this suggests that monarchs at our site are less likely to reach the Mexican overwintering site in certain years. We also report discovery of an annual monarch accumulation area on the extreme southern tip of the eastern shore of Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula.},

abstract = {Institutional and federal ethics committees regulate research on live vertebrate animals. Current regulations require researchers to provide environmental enrichment for laboratory animals. The intention is that such enrichment reduces stress and prevents atypical behavior of captive animals, enhancing the ethical treatment of these individuals, as well as providing more robust scientific results. Enrichment can take various forms but most frequently mimics aspects of the animal's natural environment, such as the inclusion of plant life, shelters, conspecifics, or providing challenges to keep the animals occupied. These approaches have proven effective for mammals and birds; however, we know little about the effectiveness of environmental enrichment for other common research taxa, such as reptiles and amphibians. These taxa are more phylogenetically distant from humans, making intuition an unreliable guide upon which to base decisions about ethics best practice, including the benefits of environmental enrichment. The eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, spends much of its time off the ground. Therefore, we provided climbing enrichment to captive fence lizards to allow them the opportunity to carry out this common natural behavior in captivity, and tested its effect on a range of ecologic- and scientifically relevant physiological and behavioral parameters. The provision of environmental enrichment, in the form of raised basking platforms, did not affect survival (P=. 0.25), baseline levels of plasma corticosterone (an indicator of physiological stress; P=. 0.81), activity (P=. 0.19), basking behavior (P=. 0.89), time spent hiding (P=. 0.59), growth (mass: P=. 0.44; snout-vent length: P=. 0.47), or overall body condition of these lizards (P=. 0.61). This lack of an effect highlights the need for researchers to objectively test the effectiveness of enrichment, rather than relying on subjectivity and anthropomorphism when making decisions about their use. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Our intended audience is field ecologists in general and, in particular, wildlife and fisheries biologists who are attempting to measure the extent to which real animal populations are selective in their choice of food and habitat. As such, we have made no attempt to address those aspects of theoretical ecology that are concerned with how animals might choose their resources if they acted in an optimal manner. The book is based on the concept of a resource selection function (RSF), where this is a function of characteristics measured on resourceunits such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used. We argue that this concept leads to a unified theory for the analysis and interpretation of data on resource selection and can replace many ad hoc statistical methods that have been used in the past.},

Over 13 mo we used 24 remote video-camera traps to monitor habitat use of sympatric chimpanzee, gorilla and elephant in four different habitat types in Loango National Park, Gabon. Habitat use by each species was predicted to vary according to seasonal changes in food availability and precipitation. Increased interspecific competition between the three species was expected at times of reduced resource availability, leading to exclusion of the inferior competitor. Supporting the predictions, species abundance per habitat showed seasonal variation: all three species responded positively to increased fruit availability in all habitats, but the response was only significant for gorilla in mature forest and elephant in coastal forest. Responses to rainfall varied, with the chimpanzee responding negatively to rainfall in swamp forest, the gorilla responding positively to rainfall in coastal and secondary forest, and the elephant responding positively to rainfall in mature forest. Elephant presence resulted in competitive exclusion of the apes under certain conditions: the chimpanzee was excluded by the elephant where fruit availability was low, whereas the gorilla was excluded by the elephant in areas of low herb density despite high fruit availability. Our results emphasize the value of applying a multi-species, longer-term approach to studying variation in habitat use among sympatric species and highlight the impact competitors can exert on one another's distribution.},

abstract = {Studying animal movement and distribution is of critical importance to addressing environmental challenges including invasive species, infectious diseases, climate and land-use change. Motion sensitive camera traps offer a visual sensor to record the presence of a broad range of species providing location – specific information on movement and behavior. Modern digital camera traps that record video present not only new analytical opportunities, but also new data management challenges. This paper describes our experience with a terrestrial animal monitoring system at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Our camera network captured the spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial bird and mammal activity at the site - data relevant to immediate science questions, and long-term conservation issues. We believe that the experience gained and lessons learned during our year-long deployment and testing of the camera traps as well as the developed solutions are applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for the advancement of the sensor network research. We suggest that the continued development of these hardware, software, and analytical tools, in concert, offer an exciting sensor- network solution to monitoring of animal populations which could realistically scale over larger areas and time spans.},

abstract = {1. The selection ratio (SR), i.e. the ratio of proportional use of a habitat over proportional availability of this habitat, has for long been the standard metric of habitat selection analyses. It is easy to compute and directly estimates disproportionate use. Its apparent restriction to habitat selection analyses using categorical predictors led to the development of the resource selection functions (RSF) approach, which has now become the norm. 2. The RSF approach has however led to debates and confusion. For instance, what functional form can be used remains debated, and the concept of relative probability of selection is often misunderstood. 3. I propose a reformulation of the SR demonstrating that it can be estimated in a regression context, and thus even with continuous predictors. This reformulation suggests that RSF can be seen as an intermediate step in the calculation of SR. This reformulation also clarifies some long-standing debates about RSF and data-selection/fitting practices. 4. I further suggest that SR estimates the strength of habitat selection, but that the contribution of selection in determining use, which should be more directly linked to fitness than selection per se, should be estimated by another metric, the selection effect on use (SE). SE could be estimated simply as the difference between proportional use and proportional availability, and can be computed from SR and a density estimation of availability. 5. I conduct a habitat selection analysis of plains zebras to demonstrate the added-value of going beyond RSF scores and using SR estimated in a regression context, and of combining SR and SE. 6. Overall, I highlight the inter-relation between various metrics used to study habitat selection (i.e., SR, other selection indices, RSF scores, marginality). I conclude by proposing that SR and SE can be the unifying metrics of habitat selection, as together they offer a comprehensive view on the strength of habitat selection and its effect on habitat use.},

abstract = {Human populations continue to increase and encroach on remaining natural habitats worldwide, resulting in greater numbers and larger ranges of commensal exotic carnivores such as cats and dogs. This results in increased interactions with native wildlife. In Madagascar, we know relatively little about the effects of domestic and/or feral dogs and cats on native carnivore populations. We investi- gated spatial interactions by combining photographic sampling across seven sites with two-species co-occurrence modeling to provide the first assessment of the spatial co-occurrence of native and exotic carnivores in Madagascar, including an examination of habitat characteristics that explain these relationships. Our surveys from 2008 to 2013 accumulated 2991 photo-captures of native and exotic carnivores in 8854 trap nights. We found that native and exotic carnivores in rainforest habitat occur together less often than expected and that exotic carni- vores may be replacing native carnivores, particularly in forest areas nearest villages. Six of the native carnivores in this study had higher site use in the absence of exotic carnivores and their species interaction factors (SIF) revealed a lack of co-occurrence (e.g. SIF {\textless} 1.0). We found that nocturnal and/or crepuscular native carnivores were less likely to co-occur with exotic carnivores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combining photographic sampling with co-occurrence modeling to investigate the effects of exotic carnivores on an entire community of native carnivores. Our study exposes the strong negative influence of exotic carnivores, ranging from exclusion to complete replacement of native carnivores, and we urgently recommend a combination of targeted educational programs and removal programs to combat the influx of exotic carnivores.

abstract = {This study used coyote howl surveys combined with GIS to locate local coyote (Canis latrans) populations, determine the habitats where coyotes occur and estimate coyote group sizes in Bedford, North Chagrin and West Creek Reservations within the Cleveland Metroparks, Ohio. The CMP were established in 1917 and are the oldest park districts in the state of Ohio. There are 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) of land in 16 reservations and in 2008 approximately 43,000,000 people visited the Cleveland Metroparks. Bedford, North Chagrin and West Creek Reservations have a mixture of park, forest, woodlots, residential neighborhoods, industrial areas, commercial property, open water, streams and wetlands. Coyotes have become the {\`{i}}top terrestrial predator{\^{i}} in northeastern North America and these animals are choosing to live in urban areas where humans are present and few natural habitats are available. Very little is known about the ecology and behavior of these elusive Canids around residential neighborhoods. I examined where coyotes actually lived along park boundaries. I performed howl surveys in Bedford, North Chagrin, and West Creek Reservations. Data were collected to determine coyote location, estimation of coyote group sizes and what types of habitats coyotes responded from. Overall, coyotes were heard 16.9{\%} of the time when howl surveys were performed. Bedford Reservation had a minimum of 13 coyotes during winter months and 11 coyotes during the summer. It is believed that three coyote groups (Bedford, Cuyahoga Valley National Park and Walton vii Hills) were present around Bedford Reservation. North Chagrin Reservation had at least five coyotes during the winter and four coyotes in the summer months. West Creek Reservation had three coyotes respond to surveys in the winter and five coyotes replied during summer surveys. North Chagrin and West Creek Reservation each had one coyote group. Bedford Reservation coyote groups had similar responses during all three seasons (dispersal, breeding and pup-rearing). North Chagrin coyotes responded the most during the dispersal and pup-rearing seasons. West Creek Reservation had peak coyote responses during the breeding and pup-rearing seasons. For all three reservations, coyotes responded from natural areas more than from urban areas (Bedford 65{\%}, North Chagrin 79{\%}, and West Creek 83{\%}). Statistics showed that Bedford coyotes responded more than West Creek coyotes. More coyotes responded during the dispersal season than during the pup-rearing season. Coyote response rates increased the closer howl surveys were performed to sunset and/or later at night (closer to midnight). Coyotes also responded more to howl surveys when temperatures were low and the moon was visible. Overall, howl surveys allowed for inexpensive monitoring of coyotes over large areas in urban-park environments. Coupled with GIS, these surveys identified where coyotes lived and the habitats they used, and therefore these methods provide the tools to inform the public better about how they may coexist with coyotes.},

This is also evident in the historic lack of enriching captive environments to reduce boredom and encourage natural behavior and psychological well-being. This paper provides those responsible for the care of reptiles and amphibians a brief overview of concepts, methods, and sample findings on behavioral complexity and the role of controlled deprivation in captive herpetological collections. Most work has been done on reptiles, however, and so they are emphasized. Amphibians and reptiles, though not admitting of easy anthropomorphism, do show many traits common in birds and mammals including sophisticated communication, problem solving, parental care, play, and complex sociality. Zoos and aquariums are important resources to study many aspects of these often exotic, rare, and fascinating animals, and rich research opportunities await those willing to study them and apply the wide range of methods and technology now available. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The 24-hr rhythms of behavior and other physiological functions are based upon an endogenous self-sustained oscillation. This is proven by experiments in which animals, kept in constant conditions, show a freerunning circadian period which deviates to a certain degree from that of the earth's rotation. The 24-hr rhythms of activity are furthermore characterized by typical patterns of which the one with two peaks in one period is most com- mon. Under natural conditions, these two peaks of activity are often closely related to specific stimuli in the environment; e.g. to dawn and dusk. They have therefore been described as being directly caused by the environment. However, one may consider not only the circadian period but also the pattern part of an endogenous system. This hypothesis has been tested in experiments with finches. The results are: 1) Birds kept in artificial light-dark cycles show the same two-peak pattern either in cycles with interposed twilight or in cycles with rectangular changes between light and dark. 2) Under constant conditions, the second peak may disappear; but more often, it either remains or becomes more pronounced than under conditions of a light- dark cycle. 3) With different levels of constant intensity of illumination, the birds show dif- ferent circadian periods and different durations of activity; under these conditions, the two peaks keep the same proportional relationship to the activity time regardless of its duration. It is concluded that the basic two-peak pattern of locomotor activity is a persistent property of the circadian oscillating system.},

abstract = {Carnivores are difficult to survey due, in large part, to their relative rarity across the landscape and wariness toward humans. Several noninvasive methods may aid in overcoming these difficulties, but there has been little discussion of the relative merits and biases of these techniques. We assess the value of 5 noninvasive techniques based on results from 2 multiyear studies of carnivores (including members of Carnivora and Didelphidae) in New York forests. Two metrics were particularly valuable in assessing the species-specific value of any particular survey technique: latency to initial detection (LTD) and probability of detection (POD). We found differences in the value of techniques in detecting different species. For midsized species (raccoon [Procyon lotor], fisher [Martes pennanti], opossum [Didelphis virginiana], and domestic cat [Felis catus]), camera traps and track- plates were approximately equivalent in detection efficiency, but the potential for wariness toward the survey apparatus resulted in higher LTD for track-plates than for cameras. On the other hand, track-plates detected small carnivores (marten [M. americana] and weasels [Mustela spp.]) more often than cameras and had higher PODs for small and midsized species than did cameras. Cameras were efficient mechanisms for surveying bears (Ursus americanus; low LTD, high POD) but functioned poorly for discerning presence of coyotes (Canis latrans; high LTD, low POD). Scat surveys and snowtracking were the best methods for coyotes, which avoided camera traps and artificial tracking surfaces. Our analysis of fecal DNA revealed that trail-based fecal surveys were inefficient at detecting species other than coyotes, with the possible exception of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Genetic analyses of feces and snowtracking revealed the presence of foxes at sites where other techniques failed to discern these species, suggesting that cameras and track-plates are inefficient for surveying small canids in this region. The LTD of coyotes by camera traps was not correlated with their abundance as indexed by scat counts, but for other species this metric may offer an opportunity to assess relative abundance across sites. Snowtracking surveys were particularly robust (high POD) for detecting species active in winter and may be more effective than both cameras and track-plates where conditions are suitable. We recommend that survey efforts targeting multiple members of the carnivore community use multiple independent techniques and incorporate mechanisms to truth their relative value.},

abstract = {A native asexual gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, declines numerically when the sexual gecko Hemidactylus frenatus invades urban/suburban habitats throughout the Pacific. Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with in- creased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for inter- ference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asym- metry of the large-scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species-specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to spe- cies turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.},

abstract = {The Southeast Asian Box Turtle Cuora amboinensis is one of 18 freshwater turtle and tortoise species native to Malaysia. It is widely distributed in Southeast Asia, having four subspecies with similar habitat requirements but different geographic distribution. Among them, the Malayan Box Turtle C. a. kamaroma occurs in Malaysia. In Malaysia, as elsewhere throughout its range, the Southeast Asian Box Turtle is considered the most common freshwater turtle. Nevertheless, the survival of the species is in peril due to over-exploitation. Of the hard-shelled freshwater turtle species in Asia, it has the highest exploitation rate, and is the species most sought after by East Asian consumers and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) markets. Thousands are harvested annually in Southeast Asian source countries and exported. The Southeast Asian Box Turtle has a slow reproductive cycle characterized through late maturity and limited number of eggs. It is therefore feared that the continuous high- volume exploitation in combination with its life history might lead to serious population reductions and finally to local extinction. The species was first assessed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 1996 as "Low Risk: Near Threatened" before it was upgraded to Vulnerable in 2000. In the same year, all species under the genus Cuora were listed in Appendix II of CITES, bringing requirements of legal provenance and sustainable management to any international trade in the species. In terms of limiting trade to sustainable levels, Article IV of the Convention requires a non-detriment finding (NDF) to be made prior to the issuance of any export permit. A thorough NDF should examine levels of trade with reference to any negative or detrimental effects to the survival of wild populations, and assess various aspects of the biology and ecology of the species, its distribution, abundance and exploitation. Malaysia became a party to CITES in 1977. The CITES Management Authority (MA) of Peninsular Malaysia, i.e. PERHILITAN, had established a quota system to regulate the export of the Malayan Box Turtle from West Malaysia, but declared an export ban in 2005. Under the respective Sabah and Sarawak State-level wildlife laws, the species cannot be exported from Sabah and Sarawak. The Malayan Box Turtle is not included in the Wildlife Act 1972, and does not receive any protection or management in Peninsular Malaysia. This makes it extremely vulnerable to exploitation in Peninsular Malaysia. In Sabah and Sarawak, the collection for local use is officially regulated through a licensing system. The present study found records for high export volumes before the turtle's listing as an Appendix species and also thereafter, it further found evidence of continuing export of the species after the Malaysian export ban. In each Malaysian State, at least one supplier was operational, and in three States exporters were encountered in addition. The main destinations for illegally traded individuals are reported to be Hong Kong and mainland China. A smaller percentage is illegally imported by Singapore. Countries that engage in the pet industry of this and other freshwater turtle and tortoise species such as Japan, Europe and the USA had contributed roughly 10{\%} to the total trade of the species from Malaysia and stopped importing completely after Malaysia's export ban. Locally, the species is used by indigenous groups for consumption, and by ethnic Chinese for religious beliefs, TCM and consumption in East and West Malaysia. In the northern States of West Malaysia, Thais constitute another local consumer group. Results show that the majority of individuals traded are adults (98{\%} in Peninsular Malaysia and 88{\%} in Sarawak), and most were between 170 and 199 mm in median carapace length. A harvest survey at two suppliers in Sabak Bernam yielded 385 Malayan Box Turtles in 38 days, or a conservative mean of 1823.7 individuals per year for one supplier. Multiplication by the number of confirmed suppliers to the export market (12) provides an annual mean estimate of 21 884 illegally exported Malayan Box Turtles. There is no commercial breeding operation of C. amboinensis in Malaysia or elsewhere in the world because it is an expensive, time-consuming and economically unfeasible task. A survey in a plantation yielded an estimated population density of only 0.82 individuals/ha, which is believed to be the result of over-exploitation. Interviews with representatives of the various user groups of the Malayan Box Turtle as well as with farmers, fishers and residents provided information that indicates that the Malayan Box Turtle is rarely seen compared to 5-10 years ago. Most respondents believe that unregulated international trade has led to over-exploitation. There are indications from every State in Peninsular Malaysia that populations of the Malayan Box Turtle are over-exploited or even locally extinct. This is especially true for populations around trade centres such as cities. Despite being a commensal species, it is nowadays difficult to find a Malayan Box Turtle in the wild near residential or agricultural areas. Levels of harvest and illegal trade in the Malayan Box Turtle in Malaysia demonstrate that immediate action is needed to regulate exploitation for the future sustainable management of the species. TRAFFIC recommends the following actions are taken: [center dot] To allow populations of the Malayan Box Turtle to recover from past and current over-exploitation related to illegal international trade, a total harvest ban or rather the strict implementation of the existing export ban for the duration of one generation should be implemented by PERHILITAN.[center dot] Ports of export and import need to improve control mechanisms to prevent illegal trade. This includes the development of bribe-proof CITES permits (more signatories, digitized identification documents of exporters, etc.). The CITES MA of Malaysia, Indonesia (since many of the turtles originate from there), China and Singapore should jointly elaborate means to avoid or at least reduce forging of documents. [center dot] Increase the number of law enforcers along trade routes, trade centres and exit and entrance points. Customs, Police and Anti-smuggling Units should be established or revived to support PERHILITAN which has insufficient staff. [center dot] Officers at borders should be changed regularly to reduce the possibility of bribery. [center dot] Strict law enforcement and regular inspection of traders, markets and pet and aquarium shops should be conducted by the CITES Management Authorities in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. Eventual collaboration with the academic could lessen the workload of the CITES MAwhile at the same time providing research topics for graduate students.[center dot] The CITES authorities in collaboration with academic institutions, organizations or individuals, and accredited rescue centres should provide (refresher) training for law enforcers in species identification and local legislation.[center dot] Every State should draft a legislation to regulate the exploitation of native turtle species as provided for by the Fisheries Act 1985. At least (10{\%}) of the Malayan Box Turtle populations of each State should be totally protected and the harvest of the remainder should be regulated.[center dot] PERHILITAN should revise the Protection of Wildlife Act 1972 to include the Malayan Box Turtle and other freshwater turtles and tortoises. The Wildlife Act should regulate the number of wild-caught animals. The current situation requires a severe reduction of harvest for local use.[center dot] The international pet trade in the Malayan Box Turtle originating from Malaysia constitutes only about 10{\%} to the total trade and is considered sustainable if standing alone. It could be continued if illegal international trade for food and TCM is halted.[center dot] The CITES Authorities should not encourage captive breeding of the Malayan Box Turtle.[center dot] The CITES Scientific Authority in collaboration with local universities and NGOs should direct efforts towards detailed in-situ conservation measures and ecological studies of the Malayan Box Turtle as well as of other heavily exploited species. Long-term studies for example would be needed to provide comparative data towards determining whether the Southeast Asian Box Turtle decreased in size over time.[center dot] Malaysia is currently planning to revise their CITES implementation legislation to include [long dash] among others - freshwater turtles and tortoises and to increase penalties while at the same time providing incentives for the public to provide information on illegal wildlife trade.[center dot] As part of the ASEAN-WEN, Malaysia could set up multi-agency task forces to improve inter-agency co-operation to ease illegal wildlife trade.[center dot] If the CITES Authorities in Malaysia re-consider international trade in the species once illegal trade is stopped, harvest and export quotas should be calculated in line with the findings of this study. Furthermore, to provide a basis for sustainable trade, a rigorous survey method to estimate and monitor population trends has to be established. Minimum characteristics that should be monitored on a regular basis are the composition of population members in terms of size, life-history stages and sex, population density, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). These should be monitored once a year at the same time of the year and at the same sites. Recommended are sites that are significant trading centres around harvest locations such as Selangor, Johor, Kedah, Perak and Penang. Specifically trends of the following should be monitored:[center dot] Abundance in the wild;[center dot] Abundance in trade;[center dot] Mean size of animals in the wild;[center dot] Mean size of animals in trade;[center dot] Size-frequency distribution of population members in the wild;[cente},

abstract = {Many species of snakes use constriction-the act of applying pressure via loops of their trunk-to subdue and kill their prey. Constriction is costly and snakes must therefore constrict their prey just long enough to ensure death. However, it remains unknown how snakes determine when their prey is dead. Here, we demonstrate that boas (Boa constrictor) have the remarkable ability to detect a heartbeat in their prey and, based on this signal, modify the pressure and duration of constriction accordingly. We monitored pressure generated by snakes as they struck and constricted warm cadaveric rats instrumented with a simulated heart. Snakes responded to the beating heart by constricting longer and with greater total pressure than when constricting rats with no heartbeat. When the heart was stopped midway through the constriction, snakes abandoned constriction shortly after the heartbeat ceased. Furthermore, snakes naive to live prey also responded to the simulated heart, suggesting that this behaviour is at least partly innate. These results are an example of how snakes integrate physiological cues from their prey to modulate a complex and ancient behavioural pattern.},

abstract = {The need for alternative predator capture techniques is increasing because of concerns about the efficiency, selectivity, and injury of currently available capture methods. There also is a need for comparative data evaluating new or seldom used methods. In an initial evaluation, we first surveyed wildlife managers for information on cage-trapping; using these data, we conducted a field study of 4 coyote (Canis latrans) capture systems for animal damage management. We tested the SoftCatch¬{\textregistered}‚{\`{a}}{\"{U}}, Collarum¬{\textregistered}‚{\`{a}}{\"{U}}, Wildlife Services-Turman, and Tomahawk¬{\textregistered}‚{\`{a}}{\"{U}}, systems for capturing coyotes in Arizona and south Texas during 2001 and 2002. We determined capture efficiency and selectivity and performed whole-body necropsies to identify trap-related injuries. Surveys indicated that coyotes usually were captured in large ({\textgreater}1.6-m-length) cage-traps baited with meat or carcasses. In our field evaluation, we estimated a capture efficiency (percentage of coyote captures per capture opportunity) of 0{\%} for the Tomahawk cage-trap, 87{\%} for the Collarum, 88{\%} for the WS-T throw arm, and 100{\%} for the SoftCatch. Cage-traps were the least selective, capturing 34 noncoyote animals, and Collarums were the most selective, capturing no noncoyote animals. The WS-T and SoftCatch devices showed intermediate selectivity of 50{\%} and 69{\%}, respectively. All devices showed low injury scores relative to jawed devices in previous studies; 92{\%}, 57{\%}, and 92{\%} of coyotes captured in the Collarum, WS-T, and SoftCatch showed no indicators of poor welfare, respectively.},

For potentially emerging agents that cannot be confirmed, sufficient data on prior absence (or a prior difference in disease dynamics) are frequently lacking. Improved surveillance, particularly for neglected host taxa, geographical regions and infectious agents, would enable more effective management should emergence occur. Exposure to domestic sources of infection and human-assisted exposure to wild sources were identified as the two main drivers of emergence across host taxa; the domestic source was primary for fish while the wild source was primary for other taxa.

abstract = {How do animals use their habitat? Where do they go and what do they do? These basic questions are key not only to understanding a species' ecology and evolution, but also for addressing many of the environmental challenges we currently face, including problems posed by invasive species, the spread of zoonotic diseases and declines in wildlife populations due to anthropogenic climate and land-use changes. Monitoring the movements and activities of wild animals can be difficult, especially when the species in question are small, cryptic or move over large areas. In this paper, we describe an Automated Radio-Telemetry System (ARTS) that we designed and built on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama to overcome these challenges. We describe the hardware and software we used to implement the ARTS, and discuss the scientific successes we have had using the system, as well as the logistical challenges we faced in maintaining the system in real-world, rainforest conditions. The ARTS uses automated radio-telemetry receivers mounted on 40-m towers topped with arrays of directional antennas to track the activity and location of radio-collared study animals, 24 h a day, 7 days a week. These receiving units are connected by a wireless network to a server housed in the laboratory on BCI, making these data available in real time to researchers via a web-accessible database. As long as study animals are within the range of the towers, the ARTS system collects data more frequently than typical animal-borne global positioning system collars (∼12 locations/h) with lower accuracy (approximately 50 m) but at much reduced cost per tag (∼10X less expensive). The geographic range of ARTS, like all VHF telemetry, is affected by the size of the radio-tag as well as its position in the forest (e.g. tags in the canopy transmit farther than those on the forest floor). We present a model of signal propagation based on landscape conditions, which quantifies these effects and identifies sources of interference, including weather events and human activity. ARTS has been used to track 374 individual animals from 38 species, including 17 mammal species, 12 birds, 7 reptiles or amphibians, as well as two species of plant seeds. These data elucidate the spatio-temporal dynamics of animal activity and movement at the site and have produced numerous peer-reviewed publications, student theses, magazine articles, educational programs and film documentaries. These data are also relevant to long-term population monitoring and conservation plans. Both the successes and the failures of the ARTS system are applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for advancing sensor network research. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

abstract = {Tropical carnivores often occur at low densities and non-invasive techniques may be inadequate to meet research and monitoring goals. Live capture allows researchers to gather information such as movement and habitat use, that they would not have access to using other techniques. However, for most tropical carnivore species there have been few live trapping studies, and hence no development of cohesive protocol. For effective project design to live trap tropical carnivores, we present a review of trapping techniques from literature and personal experience. When developing a live capture study, it is important to clearly identify study goals and ensure that live trapping will provide ample data for useful inference. It is also important to increase effi cacy and effi ciency of the technique so the capture rate is maximised and the risk of negative side effects is minimised. To meet these needs it is important to assess different methods of live capture. The benefi ts and detriments of each method must be considered for applicability to the study site and target species. Once the capture method is implemented it is important to reduce the time that the animal spends in the trap, and increase effi ciency of the immobilisation process to reduce stress and improve general welfare of the captured individual. To maximise the capture rate, the spatial and temporal placement of traps and the use of baits and lures should be given careful consideration. Through review of tropical carnivore capture methods and discussion of improved effi cacy and effi ciency, researchers can better develop successful live capture projects. {\textcopyright} National University of Singapore.},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivore populations are often intensively managed, either because the carnivore in question is endangered, or because it is viewed as a pest and is subjected to control measures, or both. Most management programmes treat carnivore species in isolation. However, there is a large and emerging body of evidence to demonstrate that populations of different carnivores interact with each other in a variety of complex ways. Thus, the removal or introduction of predators to or from a system can often affect other species in ways that are difficult to predict. Wildlife managers must consider such interactions when planning predator control pro- grammes. Integrated predator control will require a greater understanding of the complex relationships between species. In many parts of the world, sympatric species of carnivores have coexisted over an evolutionary time scale so that niche differentiation has occurred, and competition is difficult to observe. Australia has experienced nu- merous introductions during the past 200 years, including those of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the feral cat (Felis catus). These species now exist in sympatry with native mammalian predators, providing ecologists with the opportunity to study their interactions without the confounding effects of coevolution. Despite an increasing body of observational evidence for complex interactions among native and introduced predators in Australia, few studies have attempted to clarify these relationships experimentally, and the interac- tions remain largely unacknowledged. A greater understanding of these interactions would provide ecologists and wildlife managers world-wide with the ability to construct robust predictive models of carnivore communities, and to identify their broader effects on ecosystem functioning. We suggest that future research should focus on controlled and replicated predator removal or addition experiments. The dingo (Canis lupus dingo), as a likely keystone species, should be a particular focus of attention.},

abstract = {Almost all publications on the activity of tree squirrels have reported average patterns for the observed group or population and provided little information about the variability of these patterns in individual animals. As natural selection operates mainly on the level of individual animals, detailed data about the everyday life of single individuals and field data of high complexity are needed. This study provides low disturbance continuous recording of the diurnal/circadian activity cycle of individual fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) in a natural setting, which allowed us to document the intra-individual and inter-individual pattern variation over the seasons. The daily onsets and offsets of activity were inferred from recordings of skin temperature using iButtons attached to the necks of 14 individual squirrels over almost four years resulting in 25 continuous records totaling 1353 days. All squirrels were clearly diurnal but varied greatly in the number of daily activity bouts showing predominantly unimodal and bimodal patterns. Variations in activity patterns were related mostly to the seasons, followed by the inter-individual variability between squirrels. Fox squirrels spent 66-68{\%} of the day in their nests in spring, summer and fall, and 77{\%} in winter. In the same season, individual squirrels exited their nests at about the same time every morning. In summer, they left their nests about 3 hours earlier in the morning than in winter. The timing of first exits was significantly correlated with the number of daily nest exits and total out-of-nest time (ONT), and both variables were significantly correlated with both photoperiod and daily maximum temperature. Squirrels studied simultaneously showed substantial day-to-day variability in both number of daily exits and total ONT that either matched or exceeded the inter-individual variability. Many squirrels left their nests occasionally during the night, while about half occasionally spent entire nights outside an insulated nest. The timing of nest entries and exits, the modality of the activity pattern, the daily proportion of rest, and the occurrence of activity during the typically inactive time of the activity cycle are all aspects of an animal's activity pattern. They should therefore receive more attention for the characterization of species-specific behavior.},

abstract = {Nonindigenous species affect native ecosystems. communities. and populations in myriad ways, from plants (and a few annuals) that overgrow entire communities. to plants and animals that hybridize individual native species to a sort of genetic extinction. Further, nonindigenous species sometimes interact to worsen each other's impact. These impacts are commonly seen in national parks throughout the United States. The key policy change required to alleviate this threat is it shift from blacklists of prohibited species and it presumption of harmlessness to combinations of white and blacklists and a presumption that any species may be damaging. This new guiding philosophy must be inculcated at international and national levels. which will not be easy during a period when free trade is seen as an unmitigated blessing. Within the United States. enhanced cooperation and coordination will be required among all parties (i.e., federal, state, kind local agencies as well as private entities) charged with managing invasions. Internationally, the key forum is the World Trade Organization. Various management tools available to combat nonindigenous species have produced some striking successes, but new research could improve their effectiveness and reliability. There is a particular need for research on ecosystem management to control introduced species. In the face of the increasingly publicized onslaught of invaders, there is a widespread tendency to view increased biotic homogenization as inevitable. However, advances in both policy and technology, could greatly slow this process and perhaps (in concert with restoration measures) even reverse it. The necessary pressure and resources to effect these changes must come from an increasingly alarmed and vocal public.},

abstract = {1. Faecal pellet group (FPG) count data are widely used to estimate animal abundance, with two alternative methods normally employed. Faecal accumulation rate (FAR) techniques measure the daily accumulation rate of pellet groups, while faecal standing crop (FSC) techniques measure overall density. To estimate abundance, both methods require estimates of the animal defaecation rate. FSC techniques also require an estimate of pellet group decomposition rate. In general, FAR techniques are considered less prone to bias while FSC methods are considered more precise and cost-effective. On balance, the majority of authors and practitioners prefer FSC methods, although little empirical evidence supports this decision. 2. FPG count data were obtained from 26 study areas to compare the precision of FAR and FSC count techniques when applied to wild deer populations in the UK uplands. The time needed to collect count data was quantified in 10 study areas. 3. The coefficients of variation (CV) of FSC pellet group count data ranged from 9{\%} to 23{\%} and were approximately 0�7-0�9 times those of equivalent FAR data. The precision of both methods was related to the density of pellet groups. On average, FSC count data took 80 min per plot to obtain, with FAR taking 1�6-1�9 times longer. 4. For the precision of FSC and FAR abundance estimates to be comparable in the range of conditions studied, decomposition rate trials would require a CV of 5-20{\%}. While a number of studies report this to be possible, estimates of the time needed to obtain this level of precision generally exceed the net available time that results from the deployment of FSC rather than FSC pellet group counts. 5. Synthesis and applications. Using the levels of finance available to most deer managers in the UK uplands, deer abundance estimates obtained using FSC techniques on individual study sites up to 20 000 ha appear generally less cost-effective than FAR when compared in terms of their overall precision. As FAR methods are also thought to have less potential for bias when applied in the appropriate environmental conditions, they should be preferred over FSC when estimating deer abundance in concealing habitats.},

Mixed species groups of mammals occur in many different habitats, e.g. ungulates on the savannah, primates in various types of forests and cetaceans in the oceans. Mixed species groups are very different in their duration, frequency, predominant activity and structure depending on the species interacting and the habitat they occur in. Functional explanations for mixed species groups usually fall within two categories: foraging advantages and predator avoidance. However, there could also be other social and reproductive advantages of mixed species groups that could contribute to their formation and stability. The advantages do not have to be equally distributed between the participating species and can also vary according to season and the presence of predators. It is important that all investigators of mixed species groups take their studies one step further after the naturalistic description and test the function and benefits of mixed species groups in order to give more strength to their conclusions. In this paper we review and discuss the function of mixed species groups in mammals and suggest an approach on how to investigate the function of such groups.},

abstract = {This study used The Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) and regression models to explore the relative importance of dog and owner characteristics, living environment and owner-dog interaction to household dogs' aggressiveness towards strangers, owners and other dogs. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 10 interpretable factors from the Chinese translation of C-BARQ: stranger-directed aggression, owner-directed aggression, dog-directed aggression, social fear, nonsocial fear, separation-related behavior, attachment or attention-seeking behavior, trainability, excitability and pain sensitivity. The factor structure of our study largely resembled that reported in Hsu and Serpell (2003) and van den Berg et al. (2006; Dutch translation of C-BARQ). All factors of the translated C-BARQ have adequate reliability (Cronbach ??: 0.74-0.93) and are thus suitable for measuring temperament traits in Taiwan's pet dogs. Intrinsic and environmental variables important to the three aggression subscales were not entirely the same, but breed (P ??? 0.020) and physical punishment (P ??? 0.053) had significant relationships with all of them. Golden Retriever scored the lowest while dogs subjected to physical reprimands scored significantly higher on aggression subscales. In addition, higher scores on stranger-directed aggression were associated (P ??? 0.027) with living in rural areas, in houses with yard space and with more household members and being acquired either as puppies or for guarding purposes. Higher scores on owner-directed aggression were associated (P ??? 0.040) with male and older dogs, being neutered/spayed, having female owners, fewer other dogs in the household and being kept outside the house. Higher scores on dog-directed aggression, on the other hand, were associated (P ??? 0.050) with living in houses with either yard space or more household members and with spending less time with owners. Stranger- and dog-directed aggression had more important intrinsic and environmental variables common to them than did owner-directed aggression, which suggests that aggression towards owners may be regulated by different mechanisms from aggression towards strangers and other dogs. Although no causal relationship between dog aggression and environmental variables can be implied from observational studies, the results of this and other studies lend support to the possibility of reducing dogs' aggressive responses through proper management by owners. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

During the research 243 cats and 134 dogs were examined, four research groups of healthy cats and dogs aged from 1.5 to 5 years were selected and formed for studies. All groups of animals were prescribed oral hormone containing contraceptive drugs with active ingredient megestrol acetate. Groups were formed according to the common animal owners asked oral hormonal contraceptive for the suppression of sexual function in cats and dogs. Medicaments were prescribed to the experimental animals within 2 years. It was proved that the best way to use progestogenic drugs for cats and dogs is a period of about 7–15 days before the estrus. The changes that have occurred are reversible in the reproductive system. In the appointment of contraceptives at the time of proestrus increases the probability of disease of the reproductive system in cats and dogs. When using the direct drugs for interrupting the heat in cats and dogs, especially in a dose at 2–6 times exceeded, it could lead to irreversible damage of the reproductive system in most animals.},

abstract = {Population control of socially complex species may have profound ecological implications that remain largely invisible if only their abundance is considered. Here we discuss the effects of control on a socially complex top-order predator, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo). Since European occupation of Australia, dingoes have been controlled over much of the continent. Our aim was to investigate the effects of control on their abundance and social stability. We hypothesized that dingo abundance and social stability are not linearly related, and proposed a theoretical model in which dingo populations may fluctuate between three main states: (A) below carrying capacity and socially fractured, (B) above carrying capacity and socially fractured, or (C) at carrying capacity and socially stable. We predicted that lethal control would drive dingoes into the unstable states A or B, and that relaxation of control would allow recovery towards C. We tested our predictions by surveying relative abundance (track density) and indicators of social stability (scent-marking and howling) at seven sites in the arid zone subject to differing degrees of control. We also monitored changes in dingo abundance and social stability following relaxation and intensification of control. Sites where dingoes had been controlled within the previous two years were characterized by low scent-marking activity, but abundance was similar at sites with and without control. Signs of social stability steadily increased the longer an area was allowed to recover from control, but change in abundance did not follow a consistent path. Comparison of abundance and stability among all sites and years demonstrated that control severely fractures social groups, but that the effect of control on abundance was neither consistent nor predictable. Management decisions involving large social predators must therefore consider social stability to ensure their conservation and ecological functioning.},

abstract = {The establishment of protected areas is a key strategy for preserving biodiversity. However, human use of protected areas can cause disturbance to wildlife, especially in areas that allow hunting and if humans are accompanied by dogs (Canis familiaris). We used citizen-science run camera traps to investigate how humans, dogs and coyotes (Canis latrans) used 33 protected areas and analyzed behavioral responses by three prey species: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and northern raccoon (Procyon lotor). We obtained 52,863 detections of native wildlife, 162,418 detections of humans and 23,332 detections of dogs over 42,874 camera nights. Most dogs (99{\%}) were on the trail, and 89{\%} of off-trail dogs were accompanied by humans. Prey avoided dogs, humans and coyotes temporally, but did not avoid them spatially, or greatly increase vigilance. Our results indicate that humans are perceived as a greater risk than coyotes, and this increases when dogs accompany their owners. The concentration of dogs on the trail with their owners, and relatively minor behavioral impacts on prey, contrasts the strong negative ecological effects found in studies of free-ranging dogs. We found dog management to be effective: prohibiting dogs in protected areas reduced their use of an area by a factor of 10 and leash laws increased leashing rates by 21{\%}. Although millions of dogs use natural areas in North America each year, regulations enacted by protected areas combined with responsible management of dog behavior greatly reduce the ecological impact of man's best friend.},

abstract = {The cane toad Bufo marinus has been migrating westward across northern Australia since its introduction as a biological control agent in 1935. It has been implicated in the widespread decline of many native frog-eating predators. To investigate the impacts of this invasive species on native predatory reptiles, annual surveys were conducted from 2001 to 2007 to document variation in the relative abundances of three varanid lizards (Varanus mertensi, Varanus mitchelli and Varanus panoptes) and one crocodile Crocodylus johnstoni species known to consume toads. In addition, the indirect effects of this variation on one agamid lizard Amphibolurus gilberti, a known prey item of V. panoptes, were also examined. Surveys were performed at two sites in northern Australia before and after the arrival of B. marinus. Significant declines in the relative abundances of all three species of varanid lizard were observed following toad arrival. Declines in the abundance of V. panoptes, V. mitchelli and V. mertensi at the two sites ranged 83-96, 71-97 and 87-93{\%}, respectively. In contrast, A. gilberti increased by 23-26{\%}; whereas there were no significant population-level declines in C. johnstoni despite observations of individual effects (i.e. several dead crocodiles with B. marinus in their stomachs). These findings suggest population-level changes in Australian lizards caused by an invasive species.},

abstract = {1. The shade-tolerant conifer Abies alba Mill. (European silver fir) is a favoured browse species of several large herbivores. We performed an experiment to investigate how sun or shade conditions influence the recovery of A. alba saplings following simulated browsing. The browsing treatment involved clipping the leader and/or lateral shoots. For two growing seasons after applying the treat- ment, we recorded various measures of plant growth including bud development and the origin of new leaders. We then harvested the trees to determine patterns of above-ground biomass allocation. In the discussion, we consider the physiological basis for the observed responses to damage and evaluate the hypothesis that they represent an evolved defensive strategy against herbivory. 2. After 2 years, most saplings in the sun had compensated for lost height due to leader clipping, whereas saplings in the shade lagged 1 year behind. The degree of height recovery was influenced less by the length of the new leader than by its mode of origin; thus, there was overcompensation if the new leader developed from a side-shoot turning upwards (‘flagging'), while there was under- compensation if it was produced from an interwhorl or a secondary whorl bud. Leader origin, in turn, proved to be light-dependent, with flagging occurring twice as often in sun as in shade. Some trees, mostly in the shade, produced no leader in the first year but several leaders from secondary whorl buds in the second year (i.e. multiple stemming). Clipping of the leader also induced local bud development and led to greater allocation of resources to new leaders than in unclipped trees. Clipping of lateral shoots had no effect on either height increment or growth of lateral branches. 3. We conclude that, by influencing how the new leader is produced, light availability also affects the degree to which A. alba can compensate for loss in height from browsing. A possible interpretation of the overcompensation under high-light is as a defensive reaction to escape future browsing. However, an alternative explanation is that overcompensation and other morphological reactions, for example, multiple leaders, are merely contrasting physiological responses to release from apical dominance under different environmental conditions.},

The phase state of individual insects was measured after a 4-h period of localized mechanical stimulation, by using a behavioral assay based on multiple logistic regression analysis. A significant switch from solitarious to gregarious behavior occurred when the outer face of a hind femur had been stimulated, but mechanical stimulation of 10 other body regions did not result in significant behavioral change.

abstract = {Abstract. Most ecosystems have multiple predator species that not only compete for shared prey, but also pose direct threats to each other. These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild pr{\'{e}}dation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.},

Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness. An extended use of these data over long periods of time and over large spatial scales can provide robust inferences for complex, multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of the effects of climate change on animal behaviour and distribution.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have a near-global distribution. They range from being feral and free-ranging to owned and completely dependent on humans. All types of domestic dogs can interact with wildlife and have severe negative impacts on biodiversity. Here, we use IUCN Red List data to quantify the number of threatened species negatively impacted by dogs, assess the prevalence of different types of dog impact, and identify regional hotspots containing high numbers of impacted species. Using this information, we highlight key research and management gaps and priorities. Domestic dogs have contributed to 11 vertebrate extinctions and are a known or potential threat to at least 188 threatened species worldwide. These estimates are greater than those reported by previous assessments, but are probably conservative due to biases in the species, regions and types of impacts studied and/or reported. Predation is the most frequently reported impact, followed by disturbance, disease transmission, competition, and hybridisation. Regions with the most species impacted are: South-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Asia (excluding SE), Micro/Mela/Polynesia, and Australia. We propose that the impacts of domestic dogs can be better understood and managed through: taxonomic and spatial prioritisation of research and management; examining potential synergisms between dogs and other threatening processes; strategic engagement with animal welfare and human health campaigns; community engagement and education; and mitigating anthropogenic effects such as resource subsidies. Such actions are essential for threatened species persistence, especially given that human and dog populations are expected to increase both numerically and geographically in the coming decades.},

abstract = {Functional diversity, an important element of avian biodiversity, can be examined by quantifying foraging guild composition. Understanding the ecological processes that underpin functional diversity of birds in oil palm Elaeis guineensis landscapes is important because different foraging guilds are likely to be influenced in different ways by land use practices. We surveyed birds at 55 sites within oil palm landscapes and at 20 sites within logged peat swamp forest, recording 208 species belonging to 19 foraging guilds. Oil palm landscapes supported a lower abundance of insectivorous, granivorous and omnivorous birds than did logged peat swamp forest despite the latter being severely degraded due to intensive timber extraction. However, abundances of other groups of foraging birds, such as raptors and wetland taxa, were higher in oil palm landscapes than logged peat swamp forest. Frugivorous species were more abundant in smallholdings than plantation estates, probably because of the presence of native trees. Foraging guild diversity was explained by stand-level attributes such as stand age, vegetation cover, epiphyte persistence and canopy cover. However, each foraging guild exhibited unique responses to different oil palm management regimes and stand-level attributes. Only arboreal omnivores and terrestrial frugivores were affected by the proximity of nearby natural forest. This diversity of responses implies that the occurrence of particular avian foraging guilds may not be a suitable ecological indicator of best-practice palm oil production. Our study also suggests that multiple conservation measures will be needed in oil palm landscapes irrespective of management regimes, including: (1) the maintenance of ground layer vegetation cover; (2) the pruning of oil palm canopy to permit light penetration to the ground layer; (3) re-vegetation of parts of oil palm landscapes with native trees; and (4) retention of natural and/or secondary forest patches within the boundaries of plantations},

abstract = {Sorry, there is no abstract available. Read the first few lines of the text instead! In many prey species the potential disadvantages of foraging in a group can be outweighed by shared responsibility for vigilance [for a review, see [1]]. One of the major functional explanations for the evolution of sociality in animals is that individuals in groups can decrease the amount of time they allocate to vigilance without increasing the risk of death through predation. Within a group, animals can share vigilance, while keeping constant or increasing the probability of detecting approaching predators (the 'many eyes' hypothesis [2]). Accordingly, a decrease in individual levels of vigilance with increasing group size has been reported for many species of birds and mammals [reviews in [1, 3, 4]]. This phenomenon has also been interpreted in relation to competition between group members for the exploitation of limited and ephemeral food supplies [5, 6], but the precise effect of intragroup competition on vigilance remains unclear. As Lima [3]emphasizes, the fact that individual vigilance during sleeping has been reported to decrease with group size in doves [7]tends to support the 'many eyes' hypothesis, because competition for sleep seems rather unlikely [8]. On the other hand, in dunlins (Calidris alpina) the number of vigilance bouts is affected by group size during foraging but not during preening [9].},

abstract = {We report the first satellite tracking of natal dispersal by an Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) between continents and High-Arctic ecosystems. A young female left Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Norway) on 26 March 2018 and reached Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, 76 days later, after travelling a cumulative distance of 3506 km, bringing her ca. 1789 km away (straight-line distance) from her natal area. The total cumulative distance travelled during the entire tracking period, starting when she left her natal area on 1 March 2018 and ending when she settled on Ellesmere Island on 1 July 2018, was 4415 km. This is among the longest dispersal events ever recorded for an Arctic fox. Crossing extensive stretches of sea ice and glaciers, the female moved at an average rate of 46.3 km/day ± 41.1 SD. The maximum movement rate was 155 km/day and occurred on the ice sheet in northern Greenland. This is the fastest movement rate recorded for this species. The northernmost location recorded was on the sea ice off northern Greenland at a latitude of 84.7°N. The Arctic fox was of the blue colour morph typical for coastal environments, where Arctic foxes are adapted to food webs without lemmings but with substantial inputs of marine food resources. The Arctic fox settled on Ellesmere Island in a food web with lemmings, thereby switching ecosystems. Our observation supports evidence of gene flow across Arctic regions, including those seasonally bridged by sea ice, found in studies of the circumpolar genetic structure of Arctic fox populations.

Activity data were obtained from captures for both species, and telemetry for foxes. Diet of both species was analysed in order to tease out the potential existence of exploitation competition.We found that, when active, chillas used prairies more and native forest less than expected according to availability, whereas inactive chillas (during the day) preferred native forest, the only habitat type that dogs did not use.The odds of dog occurrence increased at shorter distance to human houses, whereas the inverse pattern was observed for chillas. Poisson models showed that the number of chilla visits to scent stations was negatively correlated with the number of dog visits.We observed dogs persecuting and/or killing chillas which was also corroborated by local people that used dogs to prevent chilla-related poultry losses, supporting the idea that dogs harass foxes actively.The analysis of scats showed that dogs fed mainly on house food and domestic ruminant carcasses whereas foxes fed on hare, hens, mice and wild birds, thus suggesting that exploitation competition is not a strong alternative hypothesis as a proximate cause for the patterns observed.We conclude that dogs seem to constrain the use of space by wild carnivores via interference.},

abstract = {Complexity is an important component of behaviour, but is rarely defined or quantitatively analyzed. We tested the hypothesis that complex behaviours are functionally superior to simpler behaviours. We generated complexity values for prey-handling behaviours used by snakes based on a count of behavioural acts, coordination among acts, and the amount of the snake's body used to subdue prey. We then compared prey-handling ability between species that differed in the complexity of behaviour used to subdue mice (Mus musculus). Corn and ratsnakes (Pantherophis guttata and P. obsoleta) always constricted mice while coachwhips (Masticophis flagellum) used simpler behaviours including jaw hold and body pinning. The constrictors required fewer strikes, less time to capture and subdue mice, and killed prey more quickly than did the coachwhips. Both jaw holding and constriction resulted in severe compression of the prey, but during constriction force is exerted at many points around the prey, while using the jaws limits force exertion to two opposing surfaces. Constriction divides the tasks of seizure and subjugation between the snake's head and body, thus reducing the number of tasks the jaws must perform. Our results support the idea that constriction is an adaptation for subduing vigorously struggling prey.},

@article{Allen2013,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Terrestrial top-predators are expected to regulate and stabilise food webs through their consumptive and non-consumptive effects on sympatric mesopredators and prey. The lethal control of top-predators has therefore been predicted to inhibit top-predator function, generate the release of mesopredators and indirectly harm native fauna through trophic cascade effects. Understanding the outcomes of lethal control on interactions within terrestrial predator guilds is important for zoologists, conservation biologists and wildlife managers. However, few studies have the capacity to test these predictions experimentally, and no such studies have previously been conducted on the eclectic suite of native and exotic, mammalian and reptilian taxa we simultaneously assess. We conducted a series of landscape-scale, multi-year, manipulative experiments at nine sites spanning five ecosystem types across the Australian continental rangelands to investigate the responses of mesopredators (red foxes, feral cats and goannas) to contemporary poison-baiting programs intended to control top-predators (dingoes) for livestock protection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: Short-term behavioural releases of mesopredators were not apparent, and in almost all cases, the three mesopredators we assessed were in similar or greater abundance in unbaited areas relative to baited areas, with mesopredator abundance trends typically either uncorrelated or positively correlated with top-predator abundance trends over time. The exotic mammals and native reptile we assessed responded similarly (poorly) to top-predator population manipulation. This is because poison baits were taken by multiple target and non-target predators and top-predator populations quickly recovered to pre-control levels, thus reducing the overall impact of baiting on top-predators and averting a trophic cascade.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results are in accord with other predator manipulation experiments conducted worldwide, and suggest that Australian populations of native prey fauna at lower trophic levels are unlikely to be negatively affected by contemporary dingo control practices through the release of mesopredators. We conclude that contemporary lethal control practices used on some top-predator populations do not produce the conditions required to generate positive responses from mesopredators. Functional relationships between sympatric terrestrial predators may not be altered by exposure to spatially and temporally sporadic application of non-selective lethal control.},

abstract = {Lethal interactions among large vertebrate predators have long interested researchers because of ecological and conservation issues. Research focusing on lethal interactions among vertebrate top predators has used several terms with a broad sense, and also introduced new terminology. We analysed the published literature with reference to the main underlying concepts and the use of terminology and its ecological context. The most frequently used terms in the literature were 'predation', 'intraguild predation', 'interference competition', and 'interspecific killing'. Most studies presented evidence of the killing of the victim (77{\%}), but information regarding its consumption was not given in 48{\%} of cases. More than half of the analysed studies (56{\%}) had no solid information on the degree of competition between interacting species. By reviewing definitions and their underlying assumptions, we demonstrate that lethal interactions among large vertebrate predators could be designated using four terms-'predation', 'intraguild predation', 'interspecific competitive killing', and 'superpredation'-without the need to employ additional terminology that may increase confusion and misuse. For a correct framework of these lethal interactions it is critical to assess if the kill is consumed, if the victim is indeed a competitor of the killer, and if the prey is a high-order predator. However, these elements of the framework are simultaneously the most common constraints to studies of lethal interactions, since they often require a great effort to obtain. The proper use of terms and concepts is fundamental to understanding the causes behind lethal interactions and, ultimately, what is actually happening in these complex interactions.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs can play a variety of important roles for farmers. However, when in proximity to conservation areas, the presence of rural free-ranging dogs can be problematic due to the potential for predation of, competition with, or transmission of infectious disease to local threatened fauna. We used a frequent location radio tracking technology to study rural free-ranging dog movements and habitat use into sensitive conservation habitats. To achieve a better understanding of foray behaviors in dogs we monitored dogs (n = 14) in rural households located in an isolated area between the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and the Alerce Costero National Park in southern Chile. Dogs were mostly located near households ({\textless}200 m) but exhibited a diurnal pattern of directed excursions (forays) away from their home locations. Dogs spent, on average, 5.3{\%} of their time in forays with average per dog foray distances from the house ranging 0.5-1.9. km (maximum distance detected 4.3 km). Foraying behavior was positively associated with pasture habitat compared to forest habitat including protected lands. Foraying dogs rarely used forest habitat and, when entered, trails and/or roads were selected for movement. Our study provides important information about how dogs interact in a fine-scale with wildlife habitat, and, in particular, protected lands, providing insight into how dog behavior might drive wildlife interactions, and, in turn, how an understanding of dog behavior can be used to manage these interactions.},

Instead, we demonstrate that the effects of deep wounds inflicted are potentiated through venom with toxic activities including anticoagulation and shock induction.

We collected paired accelerometer readings and behavioral observations from captive individuals. We then employed techniques from machine learning to develop an automatic system for coding accelerometer readings into behavioral categories.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in GPS technology have created both opportunities in ecology as well as a need for analytical tools that can deal with the growing volume of data and ancillary variables associated with each location.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present T-LoCoH, a home range construction algorithm that incorporates time into the construction and aggregation of local kernels. Time is integrated with Euclidean space using an adaptive scaling of the individual's characteristic velocity, enabling the construction of utilization distributions that capture temporal partitions of space as well as contours that differentiate internal space based on movement phase and time-use metrics. We test T-LoCoH against a simulated dataset and provide illustrative examples from a GPS dataset from springbok in Namibia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of time into home range construction expands the concept of utilization distributions beyond the traditional density gradient to spatial models of movement and time, opening the door to new applications in movement ecology.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that African wild dogs Lycaon pictus need exceptionally large home ranges (and hence occur at such low densities) because they are limited by competition with larger sympatric carnivores, namely lions Panthera leo and spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta. To investigate this relationship at a proximate level and explore which factors mediate it, we conducted audio playback experiments examining how wild dogs responded to the simulated proximity of either lions or hyenas. The principle finding was that wild dogs consistently moved directly away from lion roars, but when played hyena whoops either stood their ground or, later, moved off in a random direction. These results suggest that lions represent an immediate high-level threat to wild dogs that is invariably best avoided, whilst the threat from hyenas may not be so great or perhaps is simply unavoidable. Wild dogs appeared to make some assessment of ambush risk during interactions with lions, illustrated by the varying latency to their retreat in habitats of differing vegetation density (and hence ambush potential). Additionally, packs with younger pups were more likely to alarm call and exhibited a slower rate of retreat in the hour following exposure to lion roars. Other variables investigated (competitor group size, lion sex, presence of pups) failed to explain variation in wild dogs' responses. 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {Giving captive animals the opportunity to interact with objects in a playful manner is often considered a method of environmental enrichment. However, the occurrence of play in nonavian reptiles is controversial and poorly documented. Similarly, the role of environmental enrichment in fostering psychological well- being in reptiles has been little studied. For several years, an adult, long-term captive, Nile soft-shelled turtle, Trionyx triunguis, at the National Zoo (Wash- ington, D.C.), was provided objects such as balls, sticks, and hoses in an attempt to reduce self-mutilation behavior. The turtle spent considerable time with the objects, and the level of self-mutilation behavior decreased greatly over many months. Video recordings made in various contexts were analyzed in detail, and an ethogram of this turtles behavior was developed. The turtle interacted with the objects (e.g., basketball, hose, stick) for 20.7{\%} of the time it was observed and was active for 67.7{\%} of the time. Both figures are unusually high for any animal, especially a turtle. The relative lack of play in ectothermic reptiles is supported by the surplus resource theory of play, which considers the joint effects of parental care, metabolism, endothermy, and arousal in providing the context in which playfulness could be manifested and promoted in vertebrate evolution. The exis- tence of vigorous playlike behavior in a member of an ancient reptilian lineage indicates that, in the right circumstances, object play can be performed by reptiles and that having the opportunity to do so may be beneficial in captivity.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) arrived in Zimbabwe ca. 1000 years ago. Numbers of free-ranging dogs have reached unprecedented levels in communal lands (agro-pastoralist rural areas), and interact with large wild carnivores along boundaries with wildlife reserves as predators and prey. This study examined a population of 236 dogs in a 33-km2 section of Gokwe Communal Land (GCL) bordering the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area (SWRA) in north-western Zimbabwe in 1995-1996. Dogs were found up to 6 km within the SWRA, and were the most common carnivore on the GCL-SWRA boundary. Observations of 16 radio-collared dogs showed that they were inefficient predators. Only 20 kills were recorded amongst the remaining dog population, of which three were wild ungulates. Dogs were unsuccessful predators due to their small group size (mean 1.7) and body mass (mean 14.7 kg), and the abundance of alternative food. It is therefore unlikely that they compete with large carnivores for wild prey. However, leopards (Panthera pardus), lions (P. leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) preyed on dogs in GCL, removing ???6{\%} of the dog population in 1993. Such predation provides ideal circumstances for disease transmission. Canid disease was prevalent in the study area; including rabies and probably distemper. The risk of infection is greatest during the dry season (May-October), when peaks in rates of disease, carnivore incursions into GCL, and predation on dogs coincided. The role of jackals (Canis adustus and Canis mesomelas) and spotted hyaena predation of dogs is discussed in relation to disease epidemics within wildlife reserves. With a dog population growth rate of 6.5{\%} per annum, and the prevalence of canid diseases, the conservation threat posed by dogs is escalating on communal land-wildlife reserve boundaries in Zimbabwe. Measures to control dog numbers and improve vaccination coverage of dogs are discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Nests were placed at lake sites with and without deer feeders, and in three habitat types: road, edge and forest. Overall nest mortality due to predators was high (89{\%}). Nest survival was 5.5 times higher at lakes without deer feeders than at those with feeders. Among habitat types, survival was highest at road nests (23{\%}), while survival rates at forest (4{\%}) and edge nests (6{\%}) were lower than that at road nests. No significant difference in survival was detected with respect to the presence of visual or olfactory cues. Our results suggest that deer feeders reduce recruitment in fresh- water turtle populations, and that generalizations regarding the negative impacts of roads should be made cautiously, in a taxon and site-specific fashion.},

However, little empirical data is available to inform dingo management or address potential dingo-human conflicts during urban planning. From GPS tracking data, the nine dingoes, predominately juvenile and female, we tracked lived within 700m of residential homes at all times and frequently crossed roads, visited backyards and traversed built-up areas. Home range sizes ranged between 0.37km2 and 100.32km2. Dingoes were mostly nocturnal, averaging 591m/h between dusk and dawn. Juvenile and adult dingoes spent up to 19{\%} and 72{\%} of their time in urban habitats. Fresh scats from most areas surveyed tested positive to a variety of common zoonoses. These data suggest dingoes are capable of exploiting peri-urban areas and might contribute to human health and safety risks, the significance of which remains unknown. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {We studied a subset of four radio-collared individuals that were a part of a larger study documenting Coywolf ( Canis latrans  ×  lycaon ; Eastern Coyote) ecology in an urbanized landscape (Cape Cod, Massachusetts), and report on the territory of a typical sized pack that was subdivided roughly in half following the death of the breeding male from the original ("Centerville") pack. The original residents lived in a winter pack size (i.e., after pup/juvenile dispersal) of three or four individuals in a 19.66 km 2  territory and a density of 0.15-0.20 individuals/km 2 , as determined by radio-tracking and direct observations, with their territory bordering that of other monitored packs. Following the death of the breeding male, two other radio-collared Coywolves (a young male from the original Centerville pack and a young female from a bordering pack) shifted their respective territories to overlap the majority of the original Centerville pack's territory. These two groups were the same size as the original pack (three or four individuals each) but occupied smaller territories (5.28 km 2  and 12.70 km 2 ) within the previous pack's territory. The combined density for the two new packs was estimated at 0.33-0.45 individuals/km 2  or 2.2 times greater than the former pack's density and was 2.5 times (0.38-0.50 individuals/km 2 ) greater when accounting for the slight (12{\%}) overlap between the territories of the two new packs. Our results suggest that local Coyote/Coywolf density (i.e., at the pack level) may increase following the death of the breeding male of a given pack, probably because of the reduced (or lack of) protection of territorial boundaries. This finding has particular relevance to Coyote/Coywolf management programs aimed at reducing local densities via removal of individuals from these populations. Further implications exist for enriching our understanding of the trophic dynamics of urbanized habitats.},

These canids are predators of wildlife and domestic stock but dingoes are considered native and anecdotal reports suggest that they may suppress foxes such that dingo/dog conservation may have a net benefit to wildlife. This study examines dietary and spatial interactions between wild dogs and foxes in the Greater Blue Mountains region of NSW to address the possibility of suppression through competitive exclusion by dogs on foxes. Predator diets were compared using faecal analysis as well as an analysis of 19 dietary studies from similar forest habitats in eastern Australia. Spatial relationships were examined using data from an extensive canid control programme. Diets of wild dogs and foxes showed a high degree of overlap in species taken, indicating potential for competition. But there was also evidence of resource partitioning with the size and arboreality of mammalian prey differing between the two predators. Wild dogs and foxes responded to different landscape-scale variation in the physical environment, but there was no clear evidence of large-scale differences in their distribution. At the fine scale there was a negative association between these predators that indicated possible temporal avoidance or localized habitat shifts. Therefore, there is evidence for dietary competition and fine-scale exclusion, but no support for landscape-scale exclusion of foxes by wild dogs in the Blue Mountains.},

abstract = {An intriguing feature of most hymenopteran venoms is that they display broad antimicrobial activity. In particular, the venoms of social Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees) represent the most conspicuous source of antimicrobial secretions. In solitary and parasitic species, venom is used to immobilize or kill prey and to preserve them as stored food for their immature brood. In social species, venom is frequently also externalized both onto the cuticle and the nest surface. This indicates that venom use in Hymenoptera is not just restricted to hunting activities or to deter predators, but is also actively used as an externalized defensive agent, providing a first chemical barrier against microorganisms present in the environment. This chapter will discuss the importance and biological significance of venom as part of an external immune defense in Hymenoptera with special emphasis on social species. In addition ecological and environmental factors constraining the use of venom as external immune defense will be highlighted.},

abstract = {For the vast majority of cases, it is highly unlikely that all the individuals of a population will be encountered during a study. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a constant fraction of the population is encountered over times, locations, or species to be compared. Hence, simple counts usually will not be good indices of population size. We recommend that detection probabilities (the probability of including an individual in a count) be estimated and incorporated into inference procedures. However, most techniques for estimating detection probability require moderate sample sizes, which may not be achievable when studying rare species. In order to improve the reliability of inferences from studies of rare species, we suggest two general approaches that researchers may wish to consider that incorporate the concept of imperfect detectability: (1) borrowing information about detectability or the other quantities of interest from other times, places, or species; and (2) using state variables other than abundance (e.g., species richness and occupancy). We illustrate these suggestions with examples and discuss the relative benefits and drawbacks of each approach.},

Reindeer from two herds, one from Kautokeino (domestic tame) and one from V{\aa}g{\aa}, (domestic wild) were tested separately and compared. Individual location within the enclosures was not affected by the power lines. Effects on restless behaviour were ambiguous, with slightly more restless behaviour in the treatment enclosures for the domestic tame reindeer, while the domestic wild reindeer maintained a stable level in the treatment enclosures, increasing with time in the control enclosures. Activity changes were slightly more common among animals within treatment enclosures for both herds, with no indication of habituation during the experiment. The domestic wild reindeer had more than three times the amount of restless behaviour than the domestic tame reindeer. Our study indicates that for reindeer in enclosures, the disturbance from a power line construction is negligible. This suggests that power lines are a minor disturbing factor compared to human handling when using fenced in areas like grazing gardens in reindeer husbandry.},

abstract = {Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution ({\textgreater}10 Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The role that oil palm plays in the Lower Kinabatangan region of Eastern Sabah is of considerable scientific and conservation interest, providing a model habitat for many tropical regions as they become increasingly fragmented. Crocodilians, as apex predators, widely distributed throughout the tropics, are ideal indicator species for ecosystem health. Drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) were used to identify crocodile nests in a fragmented landscape. Flights were targeted through the use of fuzzy overlay models and nests located primarily in areas indicated as suitable habitat. Nests displayed a number of similarities in terms of habitat characteristics allowing for refined modelling of survey locations. As well as being more cost-effective compared to traditional methods of nesting survey, the use of drones also enabled a larger survey area to be completed albeit with a limited number of flights. The study provides a methodology for targeted nest surveying, as well as a low-cost repeatable flight methodology. This approach has potential for widespread applicability across a range of species and for a variety of study designs.},

abstract = {We compared the behaviour of chimpanzees who belong to the same subspecies (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Uganda and Mahale, Tanzania. Social scratching' involves one chimpanzee scratching the body of another. This occurs at Mahale, but not at Gombe (Tanzania), Kanyawara (Uganda), Bossou (Guinea) or Tai. Social scratching was recorded in 86{\%} (19 of 22) of adult males in the Ngogo unit group. Five of 15 adolescent males and 2 adult females were also observed to scratch socially in 2002. Males that were not confirmed to scratch socially were observed only rarely during the study periods. Thus social scratching appears to be widespread in the Ngogo chimpanzees. Although males at both Mahale and Ngogo scratch each other, they do so differently. The chimpanzees of Mahale and Gombe utter two distinct sounds, called 'lip smacking' and 'teeth clacking', when grooming other individuals. Social scratching has not been observed among the Kanyawara chimpanzees in Kibale, which live only 10 km northwest of Ngogo. One possibility is that social scratching at Ngogo is a newly invented behaviour that is practiced by adult males but not by adult females.},

Once introduced to islands, cats prey on a variety of native species many of which lack evolved defenses against mammalian predators and can suffer severe population declines and even extinction. Because islands house a disproportionate share of terrestrial biodiversity, the impacts of invasive cats on islands may have significant biodiversity impacts. Much of this threatened biodiversity can be protected by eradicating cats from islands. Information on the relative impacts of cats on different native species in different types of island ecosystems can increase the efficiency of this conservation tool. We reviewed feral cat impacts on native island vertebrates. Impacts of feral cats on vertebrates have been reported from at least in 120 different islands on at least 175 vertebrates (25 reptiles, 123 birds and 27 mammals), many of which are listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. A meta-analysis suggests that cat impacts were greatest on endemic species, particularly mammals and greater when non-native prey species were also introduced. Feral cats on islands are responsible for at least 14{\%} global bird, mammal and reptile extinctions and are the principal threat to almost 8{\%} of Critically Endangered birds, mammals and reptiles.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Given the close genetic link between humans and nonhuman great apes, the well-being of the latter in captivity is understandably controversial. Behavioural signs of boredom, anxiety and stress in captive great apes have been linked to being reared in small groups or by humans, and by having a lack of control over the environment. This review proposes a new framework for great ape enrichment, inspired by a century of cognitive research. Problem-solving tasks that are designed so challenge the evolved cognitive skills of great apes might allow subjects to have more control in inherently restricted environments. These sorts of tasks have historically been used to test the comparative cognitive abilities of great apes housed in research facilities, with few parallel assessments of well-being. However, there is great potential for 'cognitive challenge' tasks to be applied to great apes in a range of captive settings for the enhancement of well-being. This is based on recent research on farmed animals, demonstrating that they may seek cognitive challenges and benefit from their own learning success. A new definition of 'cognitive enrichment' - where an appropriate cognitive challenge results in measurable beneficial changes to well-being - is proposed to encourage research at the interface of great ape cognition and well-being. Finally, two approaches to great ape cognitive enrichment - 'low-investment' and 'high-investment' - are proposed for future research. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite their discovery roughly 200 years ago, colugos attracted relatively little scientifi c attention.

In this study, we assessed the possibility of using distance- sampling for estimating population size of Sunda Colugo (Galeopterus variegatus) in the protected forests of Singapore, and also compared this method with estimates from fi xed-width strip transect. We found that key assumptions of distance-sampling were not violated and the method provided relatively more precise estimates than fi xed-width strip transect. The population density estimate obtained was 0.535 (± 0.104) individuals per ha, and this translates to an estimated 1,074 ± 209 individuals within the 2,007 ha of protected forests in Singapore. We recommend the use of distance-sampling for the long-term monitoring of colugo populations and also discuss the viability of the species in Singapore.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the impacts of three species of introduced mammalian predators on native fauna in Australia. The feral cat Felis catus, introduced over 200 years ago, is linked with early continental extinctions of up to seven species of mammals, regional and insular extinctions of many more species of mammals and birds, and the failure of management programs attempting to reintroduce threatened native species to parts of their former ranges. Evidence for cat-impact is largely historical and circumstantial, but supported by observations that afflicted native species are, or were, small (＜200 g) occupants of open habitat and hence likely to be especially vulnerable to cat predation. The red fox Vulpes vulpes was released successfully in 1871. Its subsequent spread into all except parts of arid and tropical Australia coincided with local and regional declines of medium-sized (450-5,000 g) mammals, birds and chelid tortoises. The fox has also created recent failures of many management attempts to recover threatened native species. Unequivocal demonstration of fox-impact has been obtained in removal experiments, especially on rock-wallabies Petrogale lateralis. The dingo Canis lupus dingo, introduced 3,500-4,000 years ago, probably caused the extinction of the thylacine Thylacinus cynocephalus and Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii on mainland Australia. It effectively suppresses extant populations of large mammals, such as kangaroos, and emus, over large areas. Impacts of all three predators are wrought primarily by direct predation. Negative impacts appear to be increased in spatially fragmented forests where native species are restricted to remnant vegetation, and in arid landscapes when native species become restricted temporarily to scattered oases during drought. Alternative prey, especially rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, enhance negative impacts on native species by supporting large populations of the predators. It is concluded that feral cats and especially foxes have major negative impacts on certain small and medium-sized native vertebrates in Australia, whereas dingoes have major negative impacts on large species. Dingoes could have positive effects on smaller native species if they significantly suppress populations of foxes and cats. Further quantification of both the direct and indirect impacts of the three predators on native fauna is needed, and should be obtained from experimental field studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether or not animals habituate to repeated exposure to predator scents may depend upon whether there are predators associated with the cues. Understanding the contexts of habituation is theoretically important and has profound implication for the application of predator-based herbivore deterrents. We repeatedly exposed a mixed mob of macropod marsupials to olfactory scents (urine, feces) from a sympatric predator (Canis lupus dingo), along with a control (water). If these predator cues were alarming, we expected that over time, some red kangaroos (Macropus rufous), western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and agile wallabies (Macropus agilis) would elect to not participate in cafeteria trials because the scents provided information about the riskiness of the area.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the effects of urine and feces independently and expected that urine would elicit a stronger reaction because it contains a broader class of infochemicals (pheromones, kairomones). Finally, we scored non-invasive indicators (flight and alarm stomps) to determine whether fear or altered palatability was responsible for the response. Repeated exposure reduced macropodid foraging on food associated with 40 ml of dingo urine, X = 986.75+/-3.97 g food remained as compared to the tap water control, X = 209.0+/-107.0 g (P{\textless}0.001). Macropodids fled more when encountering a urine treatment, X = 4.50+/-2.08 flights, as compared to the control, X = 0 flights (P{\textless}0.001). There was no difference in effect between urine or feces treatments (P{\textgreater}0.5). Macropodids did not habituate to repeated exposure to predator scents, rather they avoided the entire experimental area after 10 days of trials (R(2) = 83.8; P{\textless}0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Responses to urine and feces were indistinguishable; both elicited fear-based responses and deterred foraging. Despite repeated exposure to predator-related cues in the absence of a predator, macropodids persistently avoided an area of highly palatable food. Area avoidance is consistent with that observed from other species following repeated anti-predator conditioning, However, this is the first time this response has been experimentally observed among medium or large vertebrates - where a local response is observed spatially and an area effect is revealed over time.},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {The establishment of protected areas is a key strategy for preserving biodiversity. However, human use of protected areas can cause disturbance to wildlife, especially in areas that allow hunting and if humans are accompanied by dogs (Canis familiaris). We used citizen-science run camera traps to investigate how humans, dogs and coyotes (Canis latrans) used 33 protected areas and analyzed behavioral responses by three prey species: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and northern raccoon (Procyon lotor). We obtained 52,863 detections of native wildlife, 162,418 detections of humans and 23,332 detections of dogs over 42,874 camera nights. Most dogs (99{\%}) were on the trail, and 89{\%} of off-trail dogs were accompanied by humans. Prey avoided dogs, humans and coyotes temporally, but did not avoid them spatially, or greatly increase vigilance. Our results indicate that humans are perceived as a greater risk than coyotes, and this increases when dogs accompany their owners. The concentration of dogs on the trail with their owners, and relatively minor behavioral impacts on prey, contrasts the strong negative ecological effects found in studies of free-ranging dogs. We found dog management to be effective: prohibiting dogs in protected areas reduced their use of an area by a factor of 10 and leash laws increased leashing rates by 21{\%}. Although millions of dogs use natural areas in North America each year, regulations enacted by protected areas combined with responsible management of dog behavior greatly reduce the ecological impact of man's best friend.},

abstract = {Context. Understanding the ecological impacts of the palm-oil industry on native fauna requires information on anthropogenic threats that may cause species decline or local extinction. Aim. The main aim of the study was to assess wildlife deaths caused by illegal hunting, road accidents and introduced predators in established oil-palm landscapes in Peninsular Malaysia. Methods. Between April and October 2009, we interviewed 362 oil-palm workers at 36 sites, including large industrial estates and semi-traditional smallholdings. Key results. Our results showed that (1) illegal hunting by oil-palm workers in different oil-palm management systems was not statistically significant (P = 0.097), (2) native fauna were more often destroyed as pests in smallholdings than in conventional and eco-friendly plantation estates (P = 0.005), (3) non-local poachers conducted illegal activity more often in smallholdings than in conventional and eco-friendly plantation estates (P = 0.011), (4) road accidents were reported to kill more native fauna in conventional plantation estates than in smallholdings and eco-friendly plantation estates (P {\textless} 0.001) and (5) feral dogs were reported as killing more native fauna in eco-friendly plantation estates than in conventional plantation estates and smallholdings (P = 0.034). Conclusion. In addition to the conversion of native forest to oil-palm monocultures, various other anthropogenic threats can have a substantial effect on wildlife in oil-palm landscapes. Implications. To improve the conservation value of oil-palm landscapes, we recommend that palm-oil stakeholders should implement anti-poaching patrols, organise conservation programs to educate workers, reduce vehicle speeds on roads within oil-palm landscapes, and control local populations of feral dogs.},

abstract = {Seven major types of sampling for observational studies of social behavior have been found in the literature. These methods differ considerably in their suitability for providing unbiased data of various kinds. Below is a summary of the major recommended uses of each technique: In this paper, I have tried to point out the major strengths and weaknesses of each sampling method. Some methods are intrinsically biased with respect to many variables, others to fewer. In choosing a sampling method the main question is whether the procedure results in a biased sample of the variables under study. A method can produce a biased sample directly, as a result of intrinsic bias with respect to a study variable, or secondarily due to some degree of dependence (correlation) between the study variable and a directly-biased variable. In order to choose a sampling technique, the observer needs to consider carefully the characteristics of behavior and social interactions that are relevant to the study population and the research questions at hand. In most studies one will not have adequate empirical knowledge of the dependencies between relevant variables. Under the circumstances, the observer should avoid intrinsic biases to whatever extent possible, in particular those that direcly affect the variables under study. Finally, it will often be possible to use more than one sampling method in a study. Such samples can be taken successively or, under favorable conditions, even concurrently. For example, we have found it possible to take Instantaneous Samples of the identities and distances of nearest neighbors of a focal individual at five or ten minute intervals during Focal-Animal (behavior) Samples on that individual. Often during Focal-Animal Sampling one can also record All Occurrences of Some Behaviors, for the whole social group, for categories of conspicuous behavior, such as predation, intergroup contact, drinking, and so on. The extent to which concurrent multiple sampling is feasible will depend very much on the behavior categories and rate of occurrence, the observational conditions, etc. Where feasible, such multiple sampling can greatly aid in the efficient use of research time.},

Early research conducted in captivity showed that losing fights can increase glucocorticoid (GC) secretion, a general response to stress. Because GCs can suppress reproduction, it has been widely argued that chronic stress might underlie reproductive suppression of social subordinates in cooperative breeders. Contradicting this hypothesis, recent studies of cooperative breeders in the wild show that dominant individuals have elevated GCs more often than do subordinates. The findings that elevated GCs can be a consequence of subordination or a cost of dominance complicate the conventional view of social stress, with broad ramifications for the evolution of dominance and reproductive suppression.},

Accelerometers provide information on both body posture and dynamism which can be used as descriptors to define behaviour. We deployed tri-axial accelerometer loggers on 12 free-ranging Eurasian beavers Castor fiber in the county of Telemark, Norway, and on four captive beavers (two Eurasian beavers and two North American beavers C. canadensis) to corroborate acceleration signals with observed behaviours. By using random forests for classifying behavioural patterns of beavers from accelerometry data, we were able to distinguish seven behaviours; standing, walking, swimming, feeding, grooming, diving and sleeping. We show how to apply the use of acceleration to determine behaviour, and emphasise the ease with which this non-invasive method can be implemented. Furthermore, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this, and the implementation of accelerometry on animals, illustrating limitations, suggestions and solutions. Ultimately, this approach may also serve as a template facilitating studies on other animals with similar locomotor modes and deliver new insights into hitherto unknown aspects of behavioural ecology.},

abstract = {The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that temporal variation in predation risk can inﬂuence how animals allocate feeding behavior among situations that differ in danger. We tested the risk allocation model with tadpoles of the frog Rana lessonae, which satisfy the main assumptions of this model because they must feed to reach metamorphosis within a single season, their behavioral defense against predators is costly, and they can respond to changes in risk integrated over time. Our experiment switched tadpoles between artiﬁcial ponds with different numbers of caged dragonﬂy larvae and held them at high and low risk for different portions of their lives. Tadpoles responded strongly to predators, but they did not obey the risk allocation hypothesis: as the high-risk environment became more dangerous, there was no tendency for tadpoles to allocate more feeding to the low-risk environment, and as tadpoles spent more time at risk, they did not increase feeding in both environments. Our results suggest that the model might be more applicable when the time spent under high predation risk is large relative to the time required to collect resources. Key words: Aeshna, Anura, behavior, predation risk, Rana lessonae, tadpoles.},

abstract = {Although adult crocodilians have few predators (mostly humans and other crocodilians), hatchlings and eggs are killed and consumed by a diverse array of invertebrates, fishes, anurans, reptiles, birds, and mammals. We review published literature to evaluate the incidence of predation in crocodilian populations, and the implications of that mortality for crocodilian life-history evolution. Presumably because predation is size-dependent, small-bodied crocodilian taxa appear to be more vulnerable to predation (across a range of life stages) than are larger-bodied species. Several features of crocodilian biology likely reflect adaptations to reducing vulnerability to predation. For example, the threat of predation may have influenced the evolution of traits such as nest-site selection, maternal care of eggs and hatchlings, cre`che behavior in hatchlings, and cryptic coloration and patterning. Even for such large and superficially invulnerable taxa such as crocodilians, the avoidance of predation appears to have been a significant selective force on behavior, morphology, and ecology.},

The acid detergent fiber was analyzed for amino acids to estimate chitin content. Nutrient content varied widely between the four insect species. Ranges for the macronutrients were as follows: moisture (60.2-74.8{\%}), crude protein (15.5-19.7{\%}), crude fat (1.9{\%}-29.4{\%}), acid detergent fiber (1.4-3.0{\%}), neutral detergent fiber (2.6-3.8{\%}), and ash (0.8-3.5{\%}). Energy content ranged from a low of 918 kcal/kg for house flies to 2,977 kcal/kg for tebo worms. The chitin content of these four species ranged from 6.7 to 21.0 mg/kg. The nutrients most likely to be deficient when these species of insects are used as food for insectivores are vitamin A, vitamin D, calcium, vitamin E, thiamine, iodine, and vitamin B(12) . The number of nutrients deficient vs. the NRC requirements for rats on an energy basis by insect species was as follows: soldier fly larvae (3), tebo worms (15), Turkestan cockroach nymphs (5), and adult house flies (6).

The main functions attributed to this behaviour are: detection of predators, observation of group members, location of food and avoidance of kleptoparasitism. Principal results obtained in mammals are consistent in showing that individual vigilance decreases and collective vigilance increases with increasing group size, that peripheral individuals are more vigilant than central ones and that males scan more than females during rutting period. This latter difference disappears after parturition. However, inconsistent or contradictory results concerning the influence of age, social rank, habitat and proximity of refuge do not allow determination of obvious relationships. Concurrently to those field studies, modelling the vigilance behaviour consists in estimating individual survival probability which would depend directly on the tradeoff between foraging and vigilance behaviour. However, inaccurate assumptions in the published models do not allow to consider the interspecific and intraspecific variability nor to make precise quantitative predictions. These models also raise the problem of the choice of a time scale to calculate an optimum in decision making.},

abstract = {Like most ecological communities, aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests are influenced by a synergy of bottom-up (resources-driven) and top-down (predator-driven) processes. Since the 1920s, ecologists have observed the decline of many aspen communities throughout the Intermountain West. The extent and possible drivers of this decline are topics of much recent scientific study. In addition to bottom-up effects, which include drought, fire suppression, and disease, ungulate herbivory is a contributing factor. Trophic cascades are ecological relationships in which an apex predator produces strong top-down, direct effects on its prey and indirect changes in faunal and floral communities at lower trophic levels. Apex predators, such as the gray wolf (Canis lupus), have been linked to aspen vigor and recruitment, via trophic cascades mechanisms. Scientists have hypothesized that returning wolves to the landscape enables aspen to recruit into the forest overstory, via the density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects of wolves on their ungulate prey, primarily elk (Cervus elaphus). We present a synthesis of scientific findings on this topic, identify trends in the ecological impacts of wolves in aspen communities in a variety of ecosystems, and suggest areas for further investigation. Knowledge gaps include the interaction of top-down (e.g., predators) and bottom-up (e.g., drought, fire, hydrology, logging) effects, and how the ecological context of the interaction affects the outcome. Future horizons involve exploring these food web relationships as a complex of inter-level interactions in a more integrated, empirical manner. We suggest adopting a new standard for the aspen/wolf ecology literature by shifting its emphasis and lexicon from trophic cascades to food web studies. Such an integrated approach can help managers create more resilient aspen communities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Over the last century, the wild boar (Sus scrofa) has become an important wildlife species in both economic and ecological terms. Considered a pest by some and a resource by others, its rapid increase in population and distribution has raised management concerns. Studies on activity rhythms may provide useful insights into its overall ecology and help develop effective management strategies. By examining highly detailed activity data collected by means of accelerometers fitted on GPS-collars, we studied wild boar daily activity rhythms and the effect of environmental conditions on their diurnal and nocturnal activity. We thus provided evidence of the predominantly nocturnal and monophasic activity of wild boars. All year round, we reported low activity levels during the day, which opportunistically increased under the most favourable environmental conditions. Activity was found to be significantly affected by such weather conditions as temperature, precipitation and air relative humidity. Moreover, we found that nocturnal activity slightly increased as moonlight increased. Part of our analysis was focused on the hunting period in order to investigate whether wild boars modify their activity levels in response to hunting disturbance. Our results suggested that wild boar nocturnal habits are not directly influenced by the current hunting disturbance, though we hypothesised that they may have evolved over several decades of hunting harassment. Alternatively, but not exclusively, nocturnal habits may have evolved as a low-cost strategy to achieve an optimum thermal balance (i.e., behavioural thermoregulation).},

abstract = {We compared survey techniques for estimating relative and absolute abundances of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) in New Mexico. For relative abundance surveys, the most efficient technique is collection of scats followed by verification of species depositing scats with DNA analysis. By collecting scats, the proportions of individual locations where swift foxes were detected were 61.9{\%} and 67.7{\%} during surveys in 2000 and 2001, which were greater than the proportions using scent stations (31.4{\%}, 47.1{\%}) or trapping (11.5{\%}, 8.4{\%}). By collecting scats, we detected swift foxes in 100{\%} of the fox home ranges within the study area. If scent-station surveys are used instead, scent-station transects consisting of stations spaced at 1.6 km (1.0 mile) intervals and operated for three nights are the most practical. Searching for tracks, spotlighting and calling are much less efficient techniques. For absolute abundance surveys, trapping and resighting with cameras at bait stations was more accurate than counting unique microsatellite DNA genotypes from collected scats. Using trapping/resighting, we estimated the 95{\%} confidence intervals for the swift fox population within the study area to be 17.8–30.0, 11.9–25.3 and 15.2–17.3 in the periods November 1999–January 2000, February 2000 and January–March 2001, respectively. We counted 63 and 27 unique genotypes in early 2000 and 2001, respectively. The numbers of unique genotypes, which were much greater than population estimates obtained from trapping and resighting, were overestimated because of the presence of transient swift foxes and poor quality DNA from scats leading to allelic drop-out and/or false alleles.},

abstract = {Mixed species groups have long been noted in birds, but they also occur among different species of mammals ranging from closely related species to species from different orders. Mixed species groups of mammals occur in many different habitats, e.g. ungulates on the savannah, primates in various types of forests and cetaceans in the oceans. Mixed species groups are very different in their duration, frequency, predominant activity and structure depending on the species interacting and the habitat they occur in. Functional explanations for mixed species groups usually fall within two categories: foraging advantages and predator avoidance. However, there could also be other social and reproductive advantages of mixed species groups that could contribute to their formation and stability. The advantages do not have to be equally distributed between the participating species and can also vary according to season and the presence of predators. It is important that all investigators of mixed species groups take their studies one step further after the naturalistic description and test the function and benefits of mixed species groups in order to give more strength to their conclusions. In this paper we review and discuss the function of mixed species groups in mammals and suggest an approach on how to investigate the function of such groups.},

This reflects a gradual transition in landings from long-lived, high trophic level, piscivorous bottom fish toward short-lived, low trophic level invertebrates and planktivorous pelagic fish. This effect, also found to be occurring in inland fisheries, is most pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere. Fishing down food webs (that is, at lower trophic levels) leads at first to increasing catches, then to a phase transition associated with stagnating or declining catches. These results indicate that present exploitation patterns are unsustainable.},

abstract = {Rats have reached about 80{\%} of the world's islands and are among the most successful invasive mammals. Rats are opportunistic predators that are notorious for their impact on a variety of animal and plant species. However, little documented evidence on the complexities of these interactions is available. In our study, we assessed the impact of black rats Rattus rattus introduced on a small uninhabited island with a relatively simple ecosystem, Surprise Island, New Caledonia. We also compared the diet of R. rattus in the presence and absence of breeding seabirds, assessing the dietary compensation for this potentially important food source. From 2002 to 2005, we used live trapping studies combined with stable isotope analysis and conventional diet analyses (direct observations, gut and faecal contents) to characterize the diet of rats. Our results suggest a heavy predatory impact on seabirds, which could constitute as much as 24{\%} of the rat diet. Moreover, in the absence of birds, rats compensated marginally by preying more heavily on other components of their diet but mostly acquired a new resource. They shifted their diet by preying heavily upon another endangered species, the hatchlings of sea turtles Chelonia mydas, which could constitute the main resource in the diet of R. rattus in those periods. Abundance, body condition and distribution of the rats were consistent with heavy predation upon this additional resource. Synthesis and applications. In island ecosystems invasive rats prey mainly upon seabird eggs and chicks, thereby threatening their populations. Although rats are certainly capable of surviving on terrestrial foods outside the seabird nesting season, their ability to prey upon ephemeral but abundant resources, such as hatchling sea turtles, may contribute to maintaining their populations. This may explain their success on Surprise Island, an ecosystem of extreme conditions, and suggests that biologists and managers working with threatened species should be aware of the possibility of temporary diet shifts by introduced rodents that may cause unexpected heavy predation on these species. This dietary shift from one endangered taxa to another has major implications for the conservation of seabirds and sea turtles world-wide and more generally for the biodiversity of invaded insular communities.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the ecology of food webs underscore the importance of detritus and indirect predator-prey effects. However, most research considers detritus as an invariable pool and predation as the only interaction between carnivores and prey. Carrion consumption, scavenging, is a type of detrital feeding that should have widespread consequences for the structure and stability of food webs. Providing access to high-quality resources, facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically widespread strategy. In this review, we argue that scavenging is underestimated by 16-fold in food-web research, producing inflated predation rates and underestimated indirect effects. Furthermore, more energy is generally transferred per link via scavenging than predation. Thus, future food-web research should consider scavenging, especially in light of how major global changes can affect scavengers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recovery plans for the Endangered loggerhead marine turtle Caretta caretta cite mammalian predation as a major threat, and recommend nest protection efforts, already present at many rookery beaches, to protect eggs and hatchlings. Nest protection techniques vary but wire box cages and plastic mesh screens are two common tools used to deter predation by a host of beach-foraging, opportunistic mammalian predators. We empirically tested the efficacy of wire cages and plastic mesh screens in preventing red fox Vulpes vulpes predation on artificial nests. Both techniques averted fox predation (0{\%}), whereas unprotected control nests suffered 33{\%} predation under conditions of normal predator motivation, or a level of motivation stimulated by loggerhead turtle egg scent. However, in side-by-side comparisons under conditions of presumed high predator motivation, 25{\%} of mesh screens were breached whereas no cage-protected nests were successfully predated. In addition to effectiveness at preventing predation, factors such as cost, ease of use, deployment time, and magnetic disturbance were evaluated. Our study suggests that the efficacy of plastic screens and the potential disadvantages associated with galvanized wire should influence selection of mechanical barriers on beaches where fox predation threatens loggerhead nests. {\textcopyright} 2011 Fauna {\&} Flora International.},

abstract = {Large carnivores can either directly influence ungulate populations or indirectly affect their behaviour. Knowledge from European systems, in contrast to North American systems, on how this might lead to cascading effects on lower trophic levels is virtually absent. We studied whether wolves Canis lupus via density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects on their ungulate prey species influence patterns of browsing and tree regeneration inside the Bia{\l}owie{\.{z}}a National Park, Poland. Browsing intensity of tree saplings (height class {\textless} 150 cm), irrespective of tree species or forest type, was lower inside a wolf core area (50.5{\%}) where predator presence is highest, than in the remainder of the wolf pack's home range (58.3{\%}). Additionally, browsing intensity was reduced when the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), which can act as a ʻungulate escape impedimentʼ, increased (within 5-m radius) inside the wolf core area. No relationship existed outside the core area. As a result, the proportion of trees growing out of herbivore control increased more strongly with increasing amount of CWD inside compared to outside the wolf core area. This suggests that next to direct effects of wolves on ungulate density caused by a higher predation pressure inside the core area, risk effects are important and are enhanced by habitat characteristics. These results indicate that behaviorally-mediated effects of predators on prey can become more important than density-mediated effects in affecting lower trophic levels. This is the first study we are aware of, that shows CWD can create fine-scale risk effects on ungulates with the potential for cascading effects of large predators on patterns of tree regeneration for a European forest system. This knowledge broadens the discussion on how the impact of large predators on ecosystem functioning depends on the physical landscape, by illustrating these effects for a system which largely contrasts in this respect to the North American systems.},

The study was conducted in a severely fragmented area of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. A large number of unrestricted dogs was recorded, averaging 6.2 ind/km². These dogs have owners and are regularly fed. Dog records decreased from the anthropogenic matrix to the forest patch edge, which suggests that dogs act as an edge effect on forest patches. Encounters between domestic dog and wild animals can still be frequent in severely fragmented landscapes, mainly at the forest edges. However the fact that most dogs have an owner and are more frequent in the anthropic habitat suggests that their putative effects are less severe than expected for a carnivore of such abundance, but the reinforcement of responsible ownership is needed to further ameliorate such effects.},

abstract = {Several crayfish species behave as biological invaders. Their establishment in an area has frequently been accompanied by the reduction or elimination of indigenous species. A laboratory study was designed to investigate whether the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) is dominant over the indigenous (to Delaware) crayfish Procambarus acutus acutus (Girard, 1852) in either the absence or the presence of a shelter as a limited resource. As expected, we found that P. clarkii is more aggressive than the similarly sized P. a. acutus, thus confirming previous studies that demonstrated an inherent dominance of the invasive over the indigenous crayfish. We then hypothesized that species showing a lower preference for an offered shelter (P. clarkii) should be less motivated to defend it. To the contrary, in a competitive context P. clarkii excluded P. a. acutus from the shelter but did not use the resource. Caution must be used in extrapolating these laboratory studies to the field, and future studies should analyze multiple factors, including the autoecology of the two species and their reproductive potential and recruitment patterns. However, our results might help in highlighting the risks for freshwater biodiversity created by the uncontrolled translocations of P. clarkii and other similar invasive species. ..LAN-FR Plusieurs esp√{\textregistered}ces d'√{\textcopyright}crevisses se comportent comme des envahisseurs biologiques.

abstract = {Australian examples of surplus killing by mammalian predators were collated. These included surplus killing of native mammals and birds by foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and stock, native mammals and native birds by dingoes (Canis lupus dingo). We found no examples of surplus killing by feral cats (Felis catus). Incidents collated include historical anecdotes of surplus killing by foxes as they colonised the Australian mainland, recent examples where foxes killed threatened native species at sites despite intensive management to exclude foxes, and recent examples of the killing of native species on formerly fox-free islands to which foxes gained entry. Episodes of surplus killings by foxes, other than predation on captive or closely confined animals, appeared different in kind and frequency to those documented for co-evolved predator-prey systems on the large continental landmasses. They did not appear to be uncommon events associated with synchronised births of prey species, unusual or extreme weather that disadvantaged prey species, or seasonal food caching by a predator. Rather, surplus killing events appeared to reflect ineffective anti-predator defences by prey species when encountering a novel and efficient predator to which they have had no evolutionary exposure. We suggest that surplus killing by foxes may have been a feature of, and major contributor to, the rapid mainland extinction or contraction in range of many native species in Australia. In contrast to foxes, examples of surplus killing by dingoes relate mostly to domestic stock (calves and sheep). The arrival of dingoes to the Australian continent preceded that of foxes by 3500-4000 years, but they appear not to have had the dire impact on native mammals that we attribute to foxes. This may be due to fundamental differences in hunting styles and prey size and to their sparse populations in pre-European Australia. Active persecution of non-commensal dingoes by Aborigines, the lack of free-water, and the absence of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as an alternative food supply would have limited their numbers and their impact on native mammals. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, show extreme phenotypic plasticity, transforming between a little-seen solitarious phase and the notorious swarming gregarious phase depending on population density. An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large-scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration.},

abstract = {Ecotourism involving feeding wildlife has raised public attention and is a controversial issue, especially concerning nonhuman primates. Between July 2002 and April 2005, the behavior of monkeys and tourists was collected through scan samplings, focal samplings and behavior samplings at the Shou-Shan Nature Park located in Taiwan's second largest city--Kaohsiung. In addition, the number of tourists and monkeys was counted in different hours and places within the park. Four hundred visitors were interviewed using a questionnaire to gather data on sex, age, purpose and frequency of visit to the park. The number of tourists was significantly higher during weekends than in weekdays in all locations. Humans dominated in the initiation of interspecies interactions--the overall ratio of human-initiated and monkey-initiated interactions was 2.44:1. Human-monkey conflicts accounted for only 16.4{\%} of the total interactions (n=2,166), and adult human males and adult male macaques participated in higher rates than other age/sex groups in these conflicts. Visitors showed more affiliative behavior (15.9{\%}) than agonistic behavior (8{\%}) toward the macaques. In response to visitors' threat or attack, the Formosan macaques mostly showed submissive behavior with bared teeth, squealed or ran away to avoid confrontation (69.1{\%})--only few responded with counteraggression (18.7{\%}). This study for the first time provided evidence that food provisioning increased both the frequency and duration of aggression among Formosan macaques (P{\textless}0.001). During food provisioning, the average frequency and the duration of agonistic events of macaques were more than 4 times higher compared with those without food provisioning. The average frequency of food provision by tourists was 0.73 times/hr--more than twice the incident that monkeys grabbed the food from tourists (0.34 times/hr). If people refrain from feeding monkeys and destroying the city park's natural vegetation, monkeys can be used to educate public about nature conservation in an urban setting.},

In this study, we used camera traps to photograph (capture) cats, dogs, and native wildlife in a 409-ha urban forest in Birmingham, AL from Jan-Apr 2007. Habitat treatments included forest interior and forest edges by industrial lands, neighborhoods with higher house values, and neighborhoods with lower house values. We employed both conservative (n = 31) and liberal (n = 64) methods of tallying the number of individual dogs, cats, and native mammals cap tured. Dogs and cats combined comprised 19{\%} (conservative) and 26{\%} (liberal) of all photographic captures. Procyon lotor (Raccoon) were the most abundant of the 7 native species at 32{\%} (conservative) and 53{\%} (liberal) of all captures. Dogs were more abundant in neighborhood edges, and cats were more abundant in the forest interior. Cats and dogs combined were 75{\%} (conservative) and 86{\%} (liberal) of captures from the forest interior. Captures of native species were far more frequent in neighborhood edges (conservative = 86.9{\%}, and liberal = 92.3{\%}) than in other treatments.

abstract = {Tri-axial accelerometer tags provide quantitative data on body movement that can be used to characterize behaviour and understand species ecology in ways that would otherwise be impossible. Using tags on wild terrestrial mammals, especially smaller species, in natural settings has been limited. Poor battery power also reduced the amount of data collected, which limits what can be derived about ani- mal behaviour. Another challenge using wild animals, is acquiring observations of actual behaviours with which to compare tag data and create an adequate training set to reliably identify behavioural states. Brown hares were fitted with accelerome- ters for 5 weeks to evaluate their use in collecting detailed behaviour data and activity levels. Collared hares were filmed to associate actual behaviours with tag data. Observed behaviours were classified using Random Forests (ensemble learn- ing method) to create a supervised model and then used to classify hare behaviour from the tags. Increased tag longevity allowed acquisition of large quantities of data from each individual and direct observation of tagged hare's behaviour. Ran- dom Forests accurately classified observed behaviours from tag data with an 11{\%} error rate. Individual accuracy of behaviours varied with running (100{\%} accuracy), feeding (94.7{\%}) and vigilance (98.3{\%}) having the highest classification accuracy. Hares spent 46{\%} of their time being vigilant and 25{\%} feeding when active. The combination of our tags and Random Forests facilitated large amounts of beha- vioural data to be collected on animals where observational studies could be lim- ited, or impossible. The same method could be used on a range of terrestrial mammals to create models to investigate behaviour from tag data, to learn more about their behaviour and be used to answer many ecological questions. However, further development of methods for analysing tag data is needed to make the process quicker, simpler and more accurate},

abstract = {Intraguild (IG) predation is an important factor influencing community structure, yet factors allowing coexistence of IG predator and IG prey are not well understood. The existence of spatial refuges for IG prey has recently been noted for their importance in allowing coexistence. However, reduction in basal prey availability might lead IG prey to leave spatial refuges for greater access to prey, leading to increased IG predation and fewer opportunities for coexistence. We determined how the availability of prey affected space-use patterns of bobcats (Lynx rufus, IG prey) in relation to coyote space-use patterns (Canis latrans, IG predators). We located animals from fall 2007 to spring 2009 and estimated bobcat home ranges and core areas seasonally. For each bobcat relocation, we determined intensity of coyote use, distance to water, small mammal biomass, and mean small mammal biomass of the home range during the season the location was collected. We built generalized linear mixed models and used Akaike Information Criteria to determine which factors best predicted bobcat space use. Coyote intensity was a primary determinant of bobcat core area location. In bobcat home ranges with abundant prey, core areas occurred where coyote use was low, but shifted to areas intensively used by coyotes when prey declined. High spatial variability in basal prey abundance allowed some bobcats to avoid coyotes while at the same time others were forced into more risky areas. Our results suggest that multiple behavioral strategies associated with spatial variation in basal prey abundance likely allow IG prey and IG predators to coexist.},

abstract = {Dingoes/wild dogs (Canis dingo/familiaris) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are widespread carnivores in southern Australia and are controlled to reduce predation on domestic livestock and native fauna. We used the occurrence of food items in 5875 dingo/wild dog scats and 11,569 fox scats to evaluate interspecific and geographic differences in the diets of these species within nine regions of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The nine regions encompass a wide variety of ecosystems. Diet overlap between dingoes/wild dogs and foxes varied among regions, from low to near complete overlap. The diet of foxes was broader than dingoes/wild dogs in all but three regions, with the former usually containing more insects, reptiles and plant material. By contrast, dingoes/wild dogs more regularly consumed larger mammals, supporting the hypothesis that niche partitioning occurs on the basis of mammalian prey size. The key mammalian food items for dingoes/wild dogs across all regions were black wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), brushtail possum species (Trichosurus spp.), common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), cattle (Bos taurus) and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The key mammalian food items for foxes across all regions were European rabbit, sheep (Ovis aries) and house mouse (Mus musculus). Foxes consumed 6.1 times the number of individuals of threatened Critical Weight Range native mammal species than did dingoes/wild dogs. The occurrence of intraguild predation was asymmetrical; dingoes/wild dogs consumed greater biomass of the smaller fox. The substantial geographic variation in diet indicates that dingoes/wild dogs and foxes alter their diet in accordance with changing food availability. We provide checklists of taxa recorded in the diets of dingoes/wild dogs and foxes as a resource for managers and researchers wishing to understand the potential impacts of policy and management decisions on dingoes/wild dogs, foxes and the food resources they interact with.},

abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring programs need to be designed so that population changes can be detected reliably. This can be problematical for species that are cryptic and have imperfect detection. We used occupancy modeling and power analysis to optimize the survey design for reptile monitoring programs in the UK. Surveys were carried out six times a year in 2009-2010 at multiple sites. Four out of the six species - grass snake, adder, common lizard, slow-worm -were encountered during every survey from March-September. The exceptions were the two rarest species - sand lizard and smooth snake - which were not encountered in July 2009 and March 2010 respectively. The most frequently encountered and most easily detected species was the slow-worm. For the four widespread reptile species in the UK, three to four survey visits that used a combination of directed transect walks and artificial cover objects resulted in 95{\%} certainty that a species would be detected if present. Using artificial cover objects was an effective detection method for most species, considerably increased the detection rate of some, and reduced misidentifications. To achieve an 85{\%} power to detect a decline in any of the four widespread species when the true decline is 15{\%}, three surveys at a total of 886 sampling sites, or four surveys at a total of 688 sites would be required. The sampling effort needed reduces to 212 sites surveyed three times, or 167 sites surveyed four times, if the target is to detect a true decline of 30{\%} with the same power. The results obtained can be used to refine reptile survey protocols in the UK and elsewhere. On a wider scale, the occupancy study design approach can be used to optimize survey effort and help set targets for conservation outcomes for regional or national biodiversity assessments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sewell et al.},

abstract = {Locusts show density-dependent continuous phase polyphenism; they appear in two forms or phases, gregari- ous and solitary, and there is a continuous range of intermediates between the extreme phases. The endocrine control of phase polyphenism has been the most intensively studied in desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, Indeed, results of inves- tigations over the past 15 years, provide some of the most detailed information on the endocrine mechanisms that poten- tially regulate desert locust phase polyphenism. In addition, recent studies on the juvenile hormone titres, ecdysteroid ti- tres, the discovery of [His7]-corazonin as dark-colour-inducing neuropeptide (DCIN) and the involvement of serotonin pulse in the metathoracic ganglion that triggers behavioural gregarization in the desert locust have yielded not only a good progress in our understanding the endocrine control of phase polyphenism but also unexpected results which indicate that the endocrine control of desert locust phase polyphenism is more complex than envisioned by the classical model. This review gives an overview of the progress made to date in elucidating the hormonal control of the desert locust phase polyphenism. Moreover, this review will summarize these findings and present some questions that still need to be answered.},

abstract = {Desert locusts show an extreme form of phenotypic plasticity, changing between a cryptic solitarious phase and a swarming gregarious phase that differ in many aspects of behaviour, physiology and appearance. Solitarious locusts show rapid behavioural phase change in response to tactile stimulation directed to the hind femora. Repeatedly touching as little as one quarter of the anterior (outer) surface area of a hind femur produced full behavioural gregarization within 4 h. Solitarious locusts have approximately 30{\%} more mechanosensory trichoid sensilla on the hind femora than do gregarious locusts but have similar or fewer numbers of sensilla elsewhere on the legs. Tactile stimulation of a hind femur in solitarious locusts that had been restrained so that they could not move their legs failed to induce any behavioural gregarization. Patterned electrical stimulation of metathoracic nerve 5, which innervates the hind leg, however, produced full gregarization in restrained locusts. Our data show for the first time that the gregarizing signal combines both exteroceptive and proprioceptive components, which travel in both nerves 5B1 and 5B2, and provides us with a powerful experimental method with which to elicit and study neuronal plasticity in this system. Acetic acid odour, a strong chemosensory stimulus that activates the same local processing pathways as exteroceptive stimuli, failed to elicit behavioural gregarization, suggesting an early segregation in the central nervous system of the mechanosensory signals that leads to gregarization.},

abstract = {The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is the largest canid in South America, weighing up to 30 kg, and exhibits an omnivorous diet based on fruits and small vertebrates. Maned wolves are considered to live in monogamous pairs defending a common territory, with mates living a largely solitary life, but these conclusions come from few studies with small samples. We captured maned wolves in Emas National Park, central Brazil, and monitored their use of space using radiotelemetry. Home-range size and overlap of 45 adults, and interactions between members of 5 pairs, were investigated. Home-range sizes of resident adults averaged 80.18 km2 using the fixed kernel with 95{\%} of the locations, and averaged 13.78 km2 with 50{\%} of the locations. Overlap of 95{\%} ranges between male–male, female–female, or mixed dyads was similar, approximately 0.20, whereas 50{\%} ranges of maned wolves showed less overlap overall but more tolerance for overlap with the opposite sex. Members of a pair were located alone more often than together, and even when located simultaneously maintained a mean distance of.0.5 km apart, independent of time of day. Results are in agreement with a spatial organization based on monogamous mating pairs with little intrapair sociality, but the latter needs to be investigated in more detail.},

abstract = {Conjecture abounds while evidence is limited concerning indirect protection afforded plants by carnivorous predators in terrestrial ecosystems, apropos of the Hairston-Smith-Slobodkin (HSS) hypothesis. We conducted a field experiment with a suspected trophic cascade. Could an entomopathogenic nematode protect bush lupine by killing root-feeding ghost moth caterpillars? The experiment measured survival of lupine seedlings as a function of density of hatchling ghost moth caterpillars in rhizospheres with or without the entomopathogenic nematode. We modeled lupine survival with a hierarchical family of "one-hit dose response" models to interpret the results of the experiment. We obtained maximum likelihood estimates of parameters and selected the best-fitting model using the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). The best model fit the data closely, and SIC model selection was consistent with classical likelihood ratio test results of models nested in the one-hit family. A parallel analysis performed upon a logistic family of models yielded results of poorer fit but largely consistent with results of the one-hit analysis. Finally, we compared our model-centered approach with the conventional methods-centered approach of logistic regression in statistical packages. While these packages give correct calculations, the implications of hypothesis tests are ecologically obscure in the absence of the explicit representation of models and their hierarchical relationships. For understanding ecological data, building an explicit statistical model of the process and testing parameters can be more: informative than accepting the implicit model and testing variables in canned statistical packages. The ecological implications were that seedling survival decreased exponentially with increasing densities of root-feeding caterpillars, and the entomopathogenic nematode virtually canceled the negative effect: of this herbivore upon seedling survival. However, the significance to the broader community of this trophic cascade remains to be demonstrated. This cascade is a module or vignette within the greater food web, and additional interactions affect its influence: intraguild predation by nematode predators, apparent competition from other herbivores of lupine (each with its own natural enemies), and even more complicated interactions through competing plant species all come into play. As well, genetic variation of both the lupine and ghost moth caterpillars affects these interactions. Evidence does not support the inference that protection from ghost moth caterpillars by the entomopathogenic nematode is key to the "green" world of bush lupine.},

abstract = {high day-to-day variability in time spent above ground and ODBA with most of the variance explained by environmental conditions known to affect thermal exchange. In both years, females spent more time below ground compared with males during parturition and early lactation; however, this difference was fourfold larger in the second year, possibly, because females were in better body condition. Daily ODBA positively correlated with time spent above ground in both sexes, but females were more active per unit time above ground. Consequently, daily ODBA did not differ between the sexes when femaleswere early in lactation, even though females were above ground three to six fewer hours each day. Further, on top of having the additional burden of milk production,ODBAdata indicate females also had fragmented rest patterns and were more active during late lactation. Our results indicate that sex differences in reproductive requirements can have a substantial influence on activity patterns, but the size of this effect may be dependent on capital resources accrued during gestation.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

We investigate the effects of household and road proximity, and of dog population size in the surroundings on the invasion of cacao agroforest by dogs, and evaluate if dogs raised in the vicinity are more likely to invade agroforests than dogs of unknown origin. The study was conducted in a landscape dominated by agroforests, within the cacao growing region of Southern Bahia, Brazil. Dogs were recorded by camera-traps in 15 agroforest sites, and we identified dogs inhabiting the vicinity of each sampled agroforest site by visiting all households up to 800 m from sampling sites. We obtained 115 photographic records of 47 individuals, and identified 213 dogs inhabiting the site surroundings. The number of individuals and frequency of visit of dogs tend to be higher in agroforests located nearer a household, but were not associated with the distance to the nearest road or the dog population size in the surroundings. The frequency of visits in agroforests did not differ between dogs residing in the surroundings and dogs of unknown origin. Our results indicate that the surroundings are not the main source of dogs invading agroforests, most likely because dogs perform long-distance movements in association to humans. Strategies to reduce the impacts of dogs on wildlife will gain from studies on movement ecology and should include practices to restrict dogs' home range.},

This study evaluated the occurrence of domestic dogs in one of the world's largest urban forests, the Tijuca National Park (TNP; 3953 ha), the most visited Park in Brazil. From April to September 2016, 42 camera-trap stations, spaced 0.5 km among them, were set in TNP, covering an area of 1050 ha. Population size and density of dogs were estimated, and the spatial distribution of dogs evaluated in relation to the distance to the Park's boundaries and to paved roads. Dogs' circadian activity pattern and its overlap with those of the five most recorded native mammal species were also studied. The estimated population size of dogs was 29 ± 4.86 (mean ± SE) individuals, and the estimated density was between 0.74 ind./km 2 and 1.37 ind./km 2 . Domestic dogs were widely distributed in the Park, and the number of independent dog records was not related to proximity to paved roads or the boundaries of the Park. The domestic dog was mainly diurnal in TNP, overlapping its activity mostly with the red humped agouti Dasyprocta leporina and the coati Nasua nasua. The absence of pups indicates that dogs come from surrounding areas rather than being a feral population within TNP. Therefore, managing strategies must consider the engagement of local people.},

abstract = {Large carnivores are depicted to shape entire ecosystems through top-down processes. Studies describing these processes are often used to support interventionist wildlife management practices, including carnivore reintroduction or lethal control programs. Unfortunately, there is an increasing tendency to ignore, disregard or devalue fundamental principles of the scientific method when communicating the reliability of current evidence for the ecological roles that large carnivores may play, eroding public confidence in large carnivore science and scientists. Here, we discuss six interrelated issues that currently undermine the reliability of the available literature on the ecological roles of large carnivores: (1) the overall paucity of available data, (2) reliability of carnivore population sampling techniques, (3) general disregard for alternative hypotheses to top-down forcing, (4) lack of applied science studies, (5) frequent use of logical fallacies, and (6) generalisation of results from relatively pristine systems to those substantially altered by humans. We first describe how widespread these issues are, and given this, show, for example, that evidence for the roles of wolves (Canis lupus) and dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) in initiating trophic cascades is not as strong as is often claimed. Managers and policy makers should exercise caution when relying on this literature to inform wildlife management decisions. We emphasise the value of manipulative experiments and discuss the role of scientific knowledge in the decision-making process. We hope that the issues we raise here prompt deeper consideration of actual evidence, leading towards an improvement in both the rigour and communication of large carnivore science.},

abstract = {Investigating animal energy expenditure across space and time may provide more detailed insight into how animals interact with their environment. This insight should improve our understanding of how changes in the environment affect animal energy budgets and is particularly relevant for animals living near or within human altered environments where habitat change can occur rapidly. We modeled fisher (Pekania pennanti) energy expenditure within their home ranges and investigated the potential environmental and spatial drivers of the predicted spatial patterns. As a proxy for energy expenditure we used overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) that we quantified from tri-axial accelerometer data during the active phases of 12 individuals. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to investigate the spatial distribution of ODBA by associating the acceleration data to the animals' GPS-recorded locations. We related the spatial patterns of ODBA to the utilization distributions and habitat suitability estimates across individuals. The ODBA of fishers appears highly structured in space and was related to individual utilization distribution and habitat suitability estimates. However, we were not able to predict ODBA using the environmental data we selected. Our results suggest an unexpected complexity in the space use of animals that was only captured partially by re-location data-based concepts of home range and habitat suitability. We suggest future studies recognize the limits of ODBA that arise from the fact that acceleration is often collected at much finer spatio-temporal scales than the environmental data and that ODBA lacks a behavioral correspondence. Overcoming these limits would improve the interpretation of energy expenditure in relation to the environment.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {We developed an automated method using depth and one axis of body acceleration data recorded by animal-borne data loggers to identify activities of penguins over long-term deployments. Using this technique, we evaluated the activity time budget of emperor penguins (n = 10) both in water and on sea ice during foraging trips in chick-rearing season. During the foraging trips, emperor penguins alternated dive bouts (4.8 ± 4.5 h) and rest periods on sea ice (2.5 ± 2.3 h). After recorder deployment and release near the colony, the birds spent 17.9 ± 8.4{\%} of their time traveling until they reached the ice edge. Once at the ice edge, they stayed there more than 4 hours before the first dive. After the first dive, the mean proportions of time spent on the ice and in water were 30.8 ± 7.4{\%} and 69.2 ± 7.4{\%}, respectively. When in the water, they spent 67.9 ± 3.1{\%} of time making dives deeper than 5 m. Dive activity had no typical diurnal pattern for individual birds. While in the water between dives, the birds had short resting periods (1.2 ± 1.7 min) and periods of swimming at depths shallower than 5 m (0.25 ± 0.38 min). When the birds were on the ice, they primarily used time for resting (90.3 ± 4.1{\%} of time) and spent only 9.7 ± 4.1{\%} of time traveling. Thus, it appears that, during foraging trips at sea, emperor penguins traveled during dives {\textgreater}5 m depth, and that sea ice was primarily used for resting. Sea ice probably provides refuge from natural predators such as leopard seals. We also suggest that 24 hours of sunlight and the cycling of dive bouts with short rest periods on sea ice allow emperor penguins to dive continuously throughout the day during foraging trips to sea.},

abstract = {In addition to biting, it has been speculated that the forces resulting from pulling on food items may also contribute to feeding success in carnivorous vertebrates. We present an in vivo analysis of both bite and pulling forces in Varanus komodoensis, the Komodo dragon, to determine how they contribute to feeding behavior. Observations of cranial modeling and behavior suggest that V. komodoensis feeds using bite force supplemented by pulling in the caudal/ventrocaudal direction. We tested these observations using force gauges/transducers to measure biting and pulling forces. Maximum bite force correlates with both body mass and total body length, likely due to increased muscle mass. Individuals showed consistent behaviors when biting, including the typical medial-caudal head rotation. Pull force correlates best with total body length, longer limbs and larger postcranial motions. None of these forces correlated well with head dimensions. When pulling, V. komodoensis use neck and limb movements that are associated with increased caudal and ventral oriented force. Measured bite force in Varanus komodoensis is similar to several previous estimations based on 3D models, but is low for its body mass relative to other vertebrates. Pull force, especially in the ventrocaudal direction, would allow individuals to hunt and deflesh with high success without the need of strong jaw adductors. In future studies, pull forces need to be considered for a complete understanding of vertebrate carnivore feeding dynamics.},

We tagged 82 lactating northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) with tri-axial accelerometers and magnetometers on two eastern Bering Sea islands (Bogoslof and St. Paul) with contrasting population trajectories. Using depth data, accelerometer data and spectral analysis we classified time spent diving (30{\%}), resting (∼7{\%}), shaking and grooming their pelage (9{\%}), swimming in the prone position (∼10{\%}) and two types of previously undocumented rolling behavior (29{\%}), with the remaining time (∼15{\%}) unspecified. The reason for the extensive rolling behavior is not known. We ground-truthed the accelerometry signals for shaking and grooming and rolling behaviors - and identified the acceleration signal for porpoising - by filming tagged northern fur seals in captivity. Speeds from GPS interpolated data indicated that animals traveled fastest while in the prone position, suggesting that this behavior is indicative of destination-based swimming. Very little difference was found in the percentages of time spent in the categorical behaviors with respect to breeding islands (Bogoslof or St. Paul Island), forager type (cathemeral or nocturnal), and the region where the animals foraged (primarily on-shelf {\textless}200m, or off-shelf {\textgreater} 200m). The lack of significant differences between islands, regions and forager type may indicate that behaviors summarized over a trip are somewhat hardwired even though foraging trip length and when and where animals dive are known to vary with island, forager type and region.},

abstract = {For many animal species that are difficult to access, the behaviour of free-ranging individuals cannot be assessed by direct observation. In order to remedy this, we developed a new technique using a motion detector (acceleration data-logger) for monitoring the activity and behaviour of free-ranging vertebrates and tested its efficiency on a domestic cat, Felis catus. A total of 3615 min of surging acceleration was measured along the longitudinal body axis of an adult male cat. The cat's behaviour was also filmed for 113 min, these video data being used to correlate the logger's signals with the cat's behaviour. Acceleration data-loggers attached on the cat's collar recorded acceleration signals which were influenced by both the gravitational acceleration resulting from the body posture and the dynamic acceleration resulting from the dynamic behaviour of the cat. By applying spectral analysis based on a fast Fourier Transform to acceleration signals, body postures and some of the dynamic behaviours of the cat such as drinking, eating, and several paces of travelling were efficiently determined. The present study shows that acceleration data-loggers represent a useful and reliable system for accurately recording the activities and detail behaviours of the terrestrial animals. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Adequate vaccination coverage of free roaming dogs (FRD) against canine rabies is not achieved primarily due to difficulties in administering parenteral vaccinations to this population. One factor associated with this difficulty is the tendency of FRD to form groups, which increases their aggressive behavior, resulting in a significant risk of dog-bites for the vaccinators. This study investigated factors that influenced FRD forming groups and their home-ranges, using data obtained from photographic capture-recapture/sight-resight surveys conducted in rural Shirsuphal (584 sightings) and urban Panchkula (3208 sightings), India. In the rural site, older dogs (OR 0.5, 95{\%} CI 0.2-0.9, p = 0.03) and FRD sighted within 20 m of garbage sites (OR 0.6, 95{\%} CI 0.4-0.9, p = 0.02) were less likely to be in groups. The number of dogs sighted with an FRD decreased with increased resight-probability of that dog ($\beta$= -1.0, p {\textless} 0.001). The rural FRD with smaller homeranges were more likely to be sighted alone (OR 2.3, 95{\%} CI 1.0-95, p = 0.04) than those with larger home-ranges. In the urban site, females (OR 1.3, 95{\%} CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.002) and older dogs (OR 1.5, 95{\%} CI 1.1-2.1, p = 0.07) were more likely to be found in groups, and groups of dogs were more likely to be seen within 20 meters of garbage sites (OR 1.7, 95{\%} CI 1.5-2.0, p {\textless} 0.001). The distribution of urban FRD sighted alone, in pairs, triads, and in packs of ≥4 dogs were not random in the administrative (p = 0.02), and the two industrial (p = 0.03 {\&} 0.01) survey tracks of the urban site, implying stable groups. The resighting probability of a dog ($\beta$ = 0.3, p {\textless} 0.0001) and presence of garbage within 20 m ($\beta$ = 0.2, p {\textless} 0.0001) in the urban site increased the likelihood of sighting a FRD with other dogs. It is concluded that data on the resighting probability, presence of garbage points, and home-ranges can be utilised to guide the selection of parenteral or oral rabies vaccination to achieve a population vaccination coverage of 70{\%} to break the transmission cycle of rabies virus in FRD in India.},

Modern ecological research often involves the comparison of the usage of habitat types or food items to the availability of those resources to the animal. Widely used methods of determining preference from measurements of usage and availability depend critically on the array of components that the researcher, often with a degree of arbitrariness, deems available to the animal. This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes. This hierarchy resolves certain inconsistencies among studies of selection and is compatible with the analytic technique offered in the paper.},

abstract = {This review deals with alien species invasion in Southeast Asia, an important conservation and management concern in the region. I report on the current and potential future impacts of biological invasions on biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Current knowl- edge of the invasive species in Southeast Asia is mostly based on anecdotal observations. Nevertheless, I attempt to compile existing empirical evidence on the negative effects of the biological invaders found in the region. These impacts include displacement of native biota, modification of ecosystems, hybridization, environmental disturbance, and economic loss. Any effective counter-measure will need to involve a multi-national strategy, yet such measure is challenging due to a broad spectrum of political and economic development models among the Southeast Asian countries. An overview of the taxonomic structure of the invasive species in Southeast Asia shows that the invasive plant and fish are the most represented taxonomic groups in all countries. The current research effort in invasion ecology from Southeast Asia is not being up to international standard in comparison to other regions, and the absence of recent international journal articles on invasive plant species reveals the biases in biological invasion-related research. The lack of research capacity and financial support from governments, and the inability to disseminate scholarly data in international journals are the possible reasons for the dearth of research literature on biological invasions from the region. Finally, a forward-looking agenda for the region should include improving the quality and quantity of biological invasion research; adopting a tough approach to the illegal release of wildlife; and applying multi-national strategies that integrate data sharing, prioritization, public awareness, policy work, capacity building, conservation actions and surveillance.},

abstract = {We examined the impact of dominance on crayfish social spacing and resource control. Spatial distributions of individual crayfish, Orconectes propinquus, were recorded from five sample sites in Douglas Lake, MI, USA. Crayfish populations from each site were collected and then immediately transferred to artificial ponds in order to reproduce potential dominance hierarchies. After 15 h of observation in the artificial ponds, hierarchies were found to stabilize and dominance for each crayfish was scored based on the percentage of total fights an individual won. These dominance scores were then regressed against nearest neighbor distance obtained from field data, crayfish size, and shelter evictions observed during hierarchy formation. Dominant crayfish were found to have greater nearest neighbor distances than lower ranking crayfish. In addition, as the difference in dominance score between nearest neighbors increased, the distance between them also increased. Although claw size was an accurate predictor of dominance, size did not correlate with nearest neighbor distance. Factors such as social dynamics may thus play a larger role in natural crayfish populations than previously thought. Dominant crayfish also performed more shelter evictions during hierarchy formation, which were correlated with nearest neighbor distance, suggesting that eviction by dominant crayfish may enforce spacing. Social status appears to significantly impact crayfish spatial distribution and shelter acquisition such that more dominant crayfish exhibit increased control over space and shelter. Finally, this study suggests the possibility that stable crayfish dominance hierarchies exist in nature.},

abstract = {The energetic cost of locomotion can be a substantial proportion of an animal's daily energy budget and thus key to its ecology. Studies on myriad species have added to our knowledge about the general cost of animal movement, including the effects of variations in the environment such as terrain angle. However, further such studies might provide diminishing returns on the development of a deeper understanding of how animals trade-off the cost of movement with other energy costs, and other ecological currencies such as time. Here, I propose the 'individual energy landscape' as an approach to conceptualising the choices facing the optimising animal. In this Commentary, first I outline previous broad findings about animal walking and running locomotion, focusing in particular on the use of net cost of transport as a metric of comparison between species, and then considering the effects of environmental perturbations and other extrinsic factors on movement costs. I then introduce and explore the idea that these factors combine with the behaviour of the animal in seeking short-term optimality to create that animal's individual energy landscape - the result of the geographical landscape and environmental factors combined with the animal's selected tradeoffs. Considering an animal's locomotion energy expenditure within this context enables hard-won empirical data on transport costs to be applied to questions about howan animal can and does move through its environment to maximise its fitness, and the relative importance, or otherwise, of locomotion energy economy.},

abstract = {Habitats have substantial influence on the distribution and abundance of animals. Animals' selective movement yields their habitat use. Animals generally are more abundant in habitats that are selected most strongly. Models of habitat selection can be used to distribute animals on the landscape or their distribution can be modelled based on data of habitat use, occupancy, intensity of use or counts of animals. When the population is at carrying capacity or in an ideal-free distribution, habitat selection and related metrics of habitat use can be used to estimate abundance. If the population is not at equilibrium, models have the flexibility to incorporate density into models of habitat selection; but abundance might be influenced by factors influencing fitness that are not directly related to habitat thereby compromising the use of habitat-based models for predicting population size. Scale and domain of the sampling frame, both in time and space, are crucial considerations limiting application of these models. Ultimately, identifying reliable models for predicting abundance from habitat data requires an understanding of the mechanisms underlying population regulation and limitation.},

abstract = {Researchers hoping to elucidate the behaviour of species that aren't readily observed are able to do so using biotelemetry methods. Accelerometers in particular are proving particularly effective and have been used on terrestrial, aquatic and volant species with success. In the past, behavioural modes were detected in accelerometer data through manual inspection, but with developments in technology, modern accelerometers now record at frequencies that make this impractical. In light of this, some researchers have suggested the use of various machine learning approaches as a means to classify accelerometer data automatically. We feel uptake of this approach by the scientific community is inhibited for two reasons; 1) Most machine learning algorithms require selection of summary statistics which obscure the decision mechanisms by which classifications are arrived, and 2) they are difficult to implement without appreciable computational skill. We present a method which allows researchers to classify accelerometer data into behavioural classes automatically using a primitive machine learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbour (KNN). Raw acceleration data may be used in KNN without selection of summary statistics, and it is easily implemented using the freeware program R. The method is evaluated by detecting 5 behavioural modes in 8 species, with examples of quadrupedal, bipedal and volant species. Accuracy and Precision were found to be comparable with other, more complex methods. In order to assist in the application of this method, the script required to run KNN analysis in R is provided. We envisage that the KNN method may be coupled with methods for investigating animal position, such as GPS telemetry or dead-reckoning, in order to implement an integrated approach to movement ecology research.},

abstract = {Habitat degradation through over-grazing and wood collection is especially prevalent in developing countries such as South Africa. As human populations expand and the demand for land increases, the traditional idiom of setting aside protected areas for conservation is insufficient and assessment and protection of diversity outside these areas is needed. We assessed the impact of land use on lizard assemblages in communal rangelands in South Africa by comparing abundance, species richness and species diversity between degraded communal lands with a protected area. We first quantified vegetation differences between the study areas and found marked differences. Communal lands had significantly fewer large trees and less ground cover. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that any species of lizard was negatively affected by habitat disturbance. Some species were more common in communal lands, and species richness and diversity were also higher using certain sampling techniques. Terrestrial diversity was likely enhanced due to the preference of many terrestrial lizards for open, sparsely grassed areas. We discuss other reasons for increased diversity such as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and/or reduced numbers of predators and competitors. We also conducted surveys of households and traditional healers to investigate the relationship between human uses of reptiles and abundance. The predominant users of reptiles were traditional healers. The most commonly used species were not encountered in our field surveys, and respondents indicated that they appeared to be declining. Our results emphasise the importance of integrating local knowledge into biodiversity assessment and conservation planning. Although we did not identify a negative impact of disturbance on lizard communities, community structure was different and this likely influenced ecosystem integrity and function in some way. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {One of the main questions that ecologists pose in their investigations includes the analysis of differences in some trait between two or more populations. I argue here that asking whether there are differences or not between populations is biologically irrelevant, since no two livings things are ever equal. On the contrary the appropriate question to pose is how large differences are between populations. That is, we urge a shift in interest from statistical significance to biological relevance for proper knowledge accumulation. I emphasise that to test biologically informative hypotheses from a classical perspective, there are two tools available: (a) the use of a priori power tests; and (b) the use of confidence intervals. Using both ensures that statistical significance and biological relevance are not decoupled, and studies yielding negative results do not need to be discarded balancing the current bias in publishing mostly 'positive' results. Complex ecological questions however require the formulation of multiple hypotheses and hence the use of modern alternative tools for ecological statistical inference such as information theoretical criteria and Bayesian statistics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Most studies that investigate the effects of OSR on the opportunity for sexual selection, however, ignore the important effects that OSR has on sexual coercion. Sexually coercive behaviour by males, including forceful or subversive mating tactics and sexual harassment, may cause females to mate suboptimally and thus have important consequences for the opportunity for sexual selection. We investigated how variation in OSR affects sexual coercion in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and examined the costs of this coercion to females. Males did not change mating tactics nor did individuals perform more coercive acts in the male-biased treatment, but the net rate of coercive intersexual interactions was higher simply because there were more males present. Increased sexual coercion did not affect direct fitness components (including number, weight and survival of offspring) or the proportion of courtship displays to which females responded positively. ?? 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Under normal conditions, the 24-hour rhythm is entrained by changes in light intensity during twilight, i.e. the light and dark cycle. Many rodent species exhibit predator avoidance by adjusting their activity in relation to space or time, which is weighed against the need for food. Hence, an individual's foraging activity consists of a compromise between foraging and predation risk, in addition to competition. Our study species, the Eurasian red squirrel, is diurnal and utilises dense forest habitats. In the present study, we used non-invasive camera traps to model diel activity during the winter months in 2014–2015 (December to February 24-hour day). We found that the Eurasian red squirrels exhibited a strictly diurnal feeding activity pattern and the shape of the modelled activity curve was unimodal and concentrated in the daylight hours, starting at sunrise and peaking in the morning.},

We then review current perspective on preventative locust management, and conclude by proposing a framework for quantitatively assessing the risk that phase change will occur in local locust populations. Importantly, the data required to implement this framework can be readily collected with little additional effort or cost just by slightly modifying locust habitat survey protocols that are already in operation. Incorporating gregarization risk assessment into existing preventative management strategies stands to make a considerable contribution toward realizing sustainable goals of reductions in the pesticide, manpower and financial support necessary to combat Desert locust upsurges, outbreaks and ultimately plagues. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using a salt- marsh food web, we investigated the interactive effects of predator species richness (one to three species) and trophic composition (strict predators, intraguild predators, or a mixture of the two) on ecosystem functions such as prey suppression and primary production via trophic cascades. We found that the trophic composition of the predator assemblage determined the impact of increasing predator species richness on the occurrence of trophic cascades. In addition, increasing the proportion of intraguild predator species present diminished herbivore suppression and reduced primary productivity. Therefore, trophic composition of the predator assemblage can play an important role in determining the nature of the relationship between predator diversity and ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Worldwide, domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are one of the most common carnivoran species in natural areas and their populations are still increasing. Dogs have been shown to impact wildlife populations negatively, and their occurrence can alter the abundance, behavior, and activity patterns of native species. However, little is known about abundance and density of the free-ranging dogs that use protected areas. Here, we used camera trap data with an open-robust design mark–recapture model to estimate the number of dogs that used protected areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We estimated the time period these dogs used the protected areas, and explored factors that influenced the probability of continued use (e.g., season, mammal richness, proportion of forest), while accounting for variation in detection probability. Dogs in the studied system were categorized as rural free-ranging, and their abundance varied widely across protected areas (0–73 individuals). Dogs used protected areas near human houses for longer periods (e.g., {\textgreater}50{\%} of sampling occasions) compared to more distant areas. We found no evidence that their probability of continued use varied with season or mammal richness. Dog detection probability decreased linearly among occasions, possibly due to the owners confining their dogs after becoming aware of our presence. Comparing our estimates to those for native carnivoran, we found that dogs were three to 85 times more abundant than ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), two to 25 times more abundant than puma (Puma concolor), and approximately five times more abundant than the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). Combining camera trapping data with modern mark–recapture methods provides important demographic information on free-ranging dogs that can guide management strategies to directly control dogs' abundance and ranging behavior. },

These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: {\^{a}}€{\oe}fixed sphere-of-influence,{\^{a}}€  or {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} of each reference point), and an {\^{a}}€{\oe}adaptive sphere-of-influence,{\^{a}}€  or {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), and compare them to the original {\^{a}}€{\oe}fixed-number-of-points,{\^{a}}€  or {\textless}italic{\textgreater}k{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}k{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops).

abstract = {Abstract. Individual male guppies (Poecilia reticulata: Poeciliinae) exhibit two distinct types of mating behaviour: sigmoid displays used in courtship, and gonopodial thrusts used in circumventing female choice. To test how these alternatives are influenced by sexual selection and natural selection, ambient light levels were manipulated to vary potential predation risk, and mating behaviour was examined in relation to male morphology. At high light intensity, larger males displayed significantly less often than smaller ones, and did not compensate with increased thrusting. In contrast, at low light, display frequency was unrelated to male morphology, but thrusting behaviour became correlated positively with the length of the male's intromittent organ (the gonopodium). No colour pigment was correlated with either display or thrusting behaviour at either light level when correlations with body size were removed. The decreased courtship by larger males under high light is consistent with individual differences in a trade-off between predation risk and mating success. The correlation between thrusting and gonopodium length parallels an interspecific pattern, and suggests that gonopodium length may be coadapted with male behaviour to circumvent female choice. Thus, covariation between alternative mating behaviour and male morphology is mediated by changing environmental conditions influencing the strengths of sexual and natural selection.},

abstract = {Mountain lions (Puma concolor) live in diverse and often exceptionally rugged, complex habitats. The energy expended for hunting must account for this complexity but has been difficult to measure for this and other large, cryptic carnivores. Here we developed a physiological SMART collar that used GPS locations and accelerometry to continuously monitor energetics, movements, and behavior of free-ranging mountain lions. This large felid displayed marked individuality in predatory movements, ranging from low energetic, sit-and-wait behaviors to constant high activity chases with transport costs averaging 2.3 times predicted for running mammals. Lions reduced hunting costs by precisely matching maximum pouncing force (ODBAmax = 5.3-16.1 g) to prey size and by using cryptic behaviors. Such instantaneous energetic costs help explain why most felids stalk-and-pounce, and provide a unique approach for conserving large, mobile predators by accurately forecasting resource demands},

abstract = {Direct observations of predation on primates are rare, in part because the presence of observers deters potential predators. We observed domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) kill and take away a juvenile long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis), presumably for consumption, in Singapore's Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. We describe the event and reaction by group members in detail. We also compare our observation to reported accounts of predation on long-tailed macaques. In doing so, we discuss factors that increase predation risk for long-tailed macaques in anthropogenic environments. Dogs may not be important predators of primates in natural habitats, but currently they are important predators of long-tailed macaques in anthropogenic environments. This is because a large proportion of long- tailed macaques now live near humans. Anthropogenic environments differ from the forest environments to which long- tailed macaques are most adapted. Compared to forests, anthropogenic environments are more open, contain novel structures, and require more terrestrial locomotion. These differences pose novel ecological challenges that increase macaques' susceptibility to predation by dogs. Features of primate juvenility leave young macaques especially vulnerable to dog predation. Young macaques have a small body size and frequently play, which reduces their vigilance to predators. In sum, greater exposure to anthropogenic environments increases the risk of long-tailed macaques— especially juveniles—to predation by dogs. KEY},

Here, we discuss recent progress in the analysis of these venoms, focusing on several studies of specific venom components as well as transcriptomic and proteomic surveys. Currently available –omic technologies largely circumvent the problematic low venom yields of most rear-fanged snakes, and because their basic biology is often very different from the well-studied front-fanged snakes, there is great potential for novel compound discovery in their venoms.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The worldwide population of domestic dogs is estimated at approximately 700 million, with around 75{\%} classified as “free-roaming”. Where free-roaming dogs exist in high densities, there are significant implications for public health, animal welfare, and wildlife. Approaches to manage dog populations include culling, fertility control, and sheltering. Understanding the effectiveness of each of these interventions is important in guiding future dog population management. We present the results of a systematic review of published studies investigating dog population management, to assess: (1) where and when studies were carried out; (2) what population management methods were used; and (3) what was the effect of the method. We evaluated the reporting quality of the published studies for strength of evidence assessment. The systematic review resulted in a corpus of 39 papers from 15 countries, reporting a wide disparity of approaches and measures of effect. We synthesised the management methods and reported effects. Fertility control was most investigated and had the greatest reported effect on dog population size. Reporting quality was low for power calculations (11{\%}), sample size calculations (11{\%}), and the use of control populations (17{\%}). We provide recommendations for future studies to use common metrics and improve reporting quality, study design, and modelling approaches in order to allow better assessment of the true impact of dog population management.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {More than 600,000 ha of mine land have been reclaimed in the eastern United States, providing large contiguous tracts of early successional vegetation that can be managed for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). However, habitat quality on reclaimed mine land can be limited by extensive coverage of non-native invasive species, which are commonly planted during reclamation. We used discrete-choice analysis to investigate bobwhite resource selection throughout the year on Peabody Wildlife Management Area, a 3,330-ha reclaimed surface mine in western Kentucky. We used a treatment-control design to study resource selection at 2 spatial scales to identify important aspects of mine land vegetation and whether resource selection differed between areas with habitat management (i.e., burning, disking, herbicide; treatment) and unmanaged units (control). Our objectives were to estimate bobwhite resource selection on reclaimed mine land and to estimate the influence of habitat management practices on resource selection. We used locations from 283 individuals during the breeding season (1 Apr-30 Sep) and 136 coveys during the non-breeding season (1 Oct-Mar 31) from August 2009 to March 2014. Individuals were located closer to shrub cover than would be expected at random throughout the year. During the breeding season, individuals on treatment units used areas with smaller contagion index values (i.e., greater interspersion) compared with individuals on control units. During the non-breeding season, birds selected areas with greater shrub-open edge density compared with random. At the microhabitat scale, individuals selected areas with increased visual obstruction {\textgreater}1 m aboveground. During the breeding season, birds were closer to disked areas (linear and non-linear) than would be expected at random. Individuals selected non-linear disked areas during winter but did not select linear disked areas (firebreaks) because they were planted to winter wheat each fall and lacked cover during the non-breeding season. Individuals also selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) throughout the year. During the breeding season, bobwhites avoided areas burned during the previous dormant season. Habitat quality of reclaimed mine lands may be limited by a lack of shrub cover and extensive coverage of non-native herbaceous vegetation. Managers aiming to increase bobwhite abundance should focus on increasing interspersion of shrub cover, with no area {\textgreater}100 m from shrub cover. We suggest disking and herbicide application to control invasive species and improve the structure and composition of vegetation for bobwhites.},

abstract = {Hunting by humans constitutes a major source of mortality that selects for avoidance strategies. Group formation in eiders Somateria mollissima in response to hunting from motorboats was studied in the Danish Wadden Sea as an avoid- ance strategy to humans. In autumn the birds' food demand and energy consumption are relatively low and the need for optimal feeding opportunities are not as essential as during winter. We tested the hypothesis that eiders aggregate in groups of variable size dependent on predation risk (hunting), season and site. During autumn at the preferred feeding sites eiders occur in small numbers and group size increase together with hunting activity. Opposite during winter, eiders occur in large numbers and group size decrease when hunting activity increase. Hunting activity displaced eiders to adjacent sites with no or low hunting intensity and low food availability where group size of eiders increase during both autumn and winter in relation to the overall hunting activity. The formation into larger groups when hunting activity increase is probably due to increasing effects of vigilance and dilution, whereas formation into smaller groups is assumed to reduce the eiders con- spicuousness to hunters. This change in group size made it possible for eiders to forage in areas with high food availability and high hunting intensity, while minimizing the risk of being detected by hunters. When the largest numbers of hunters were present at the preferred feeding site, group sizes during both autumn and winter were 110–125 eiders, indicating an optimal group size in relation to hunting density. Eiders located outside preferred feeding sites were in poorer body condition, suggesting that displacement was a suboptimal decision caused by hunting. We conclude that eiders adopted regrouping and displacement as two different strategies during hunting. Both strategies are tradeoffs between the risks of being detected by hunters and killed, and the benefits of feeding on mussel stocks thereby increasing body condition and hence fitnes},

abstract = {In several field observations, foxes, Spotted hyaenas and other carnivores killed many more prey individuals than they could eat. Functional and causal aspects of this phenomenon are discussed and the conclusion is reached that these surplus kills are the consequence of behavioural compromises in both predator and prey to meet opposing environmental requirements. Summary: (1) Observations are reported in which carnivores killed considerably more prey animals than they could possibly eat, and causal and functional aspects of this behaviour are discussed. The species concerned were especially foxes and Spotted hyaenas, and references are quoted about surplus killing by other Canidae, Felidae and Ursidae. (2) It is argued that satiation in carnivores does not inhibit further catching and killing, but it probably does inhibit searching and hunting. Thus carnivores are able to procure an “easy prey” but normally satiation limits numbers killed. (3) Many, if not all, carnivores possess behaviour patterns which allow utilization of a kill at a later time, or allow other members of the same social unit or offspring to use the food. (4) Several prey species showed a lack of anti-predator reaction under particular climatological circumstances; it is argued that this lack of response usually has survival value. Sometimes anti-predator behaviour is accidentally made ineffective. (5) Surplus kills are made possible by (2) and (4) above, and only very rare circumstances give a predator access to so many prey that (3) is ineffective. It is suggested that surplus kills are the consequence of behavioural compromises in both predator and prey to meet opposing environmental requirements.},

abstract = {We propose a new method, based on machine learning techniques, for the analysis of a combination of continuous data from dataloggers and a sampling of contemporaneous behaviour observations. This data combination provides an opportunity for biologists to study behaviour at a previously unknown level of detail and accuracy; however, continuously recorded data are of little use unless the resulting large volumes of raw data can be reliably translated into actual behaviour. We address this problem by applying a Support Vector Machine and a Hidden-Markov Model that allows us to classify an animal's behaviour using a small set of field observations to calibrate continuously recorded activity data. Such classified data can be applied quantitatively to the behaviour of animals over extended periods and at times during which observation is difficult or impossible. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method by applying it to data from six cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Cumulative activity data scores were recorded every five minutes by accelerometers embedded in GPS radio-collars for around one year on average. Direct behaviour sampling of each of the six cheetah were collected in the field for comparatively short periods. Using this approach we are able to classify each five minute activity score into a set of three key behaviour (feeding, mobile and stationary), creating a continuous behavioural sequence for the entire period for which the collars were deployed. Evaluation of our classifier with cross-validation shows the accuracy to be 83{\%}-94{\%}, but that the accuracy for individual classes is reduced with decreasing sample size of direct observations. We demonstrate how these processed data can be used to study behaviour identifying seasonal and gender differences in daily activity and feeding times. Results given here are unlike any that could be obtained using traditional approaches in both accuracy and detail.},

abstract = {Researchers hoping to elucidate the behaviour of species that aren't readily observed are able to do so using biotelemetry methods. Accelerometers in particular are proving particularly effective and have been used on terrestrial, aquatic and volant species with success. In the past, behavioural modes were detected in accelerometer data through manual inspection, but with developments in technology, modern accelerometers now record at frequencies that make this impractical. In light of this, some researchers have suggested the use of various machine learning approaches as a means to classify accelerometer data automatically. We feel uptake of this approach by the scientific community is inhibited for two reasons; 1) Most machine learning algorithms require selection of summary statistics which obscure the decision mechanisms by which classifications are arrived, and 2) they are difficult to implement without appreciable computational skill. We present a method which allows researchers to classify accelerometer data into behavioural classes automatically using a primitive machine learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbour (KNN). Raw acceleration data may be used in KNN without selection of summary statistics, and it is easily implemented using the freeware program R. The method is evaluated by detecting 5 behavioural modes in 8 species, with examples of quadrupedal, bipedal and volant species. Accuracy and Precision were found to be comparable with other, more complex methods. In order to assist in the application of this method, the script required to run KNN analysis in R is provided. We envisage that the KNN method may be coupled with methods for investigating animal position, such as GPS telemetry or dead-reckoning, in order to implement an integrated approach to movement ecology research.},

abstract = {Density-dependent phase polyphenism is a defining characteristic of the paraphyletic group of acridid grasshoppers known as locusts. The cues and mechanisms associated with crowding that induce behavioural gregarization are best understood in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, and involve a combination of sensory inputs from the head (visual and olfactory) and mechanostimulation of the hind legs, acting via a transient increase in serotonin in the thoracic ganglia. Since behavioural gregarization has apparently arisen independently multiple times within the Acrididae, the important question arises as to whether the same mechanisms have been recruited each time. Here we explored the roles of visual, olfactory and tactile stimulation in the induction of behavioural gregarization in the Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera. We show that the primary gregarizing input is tactile stimulation of the antennae, with no evidence for an effect of visual and olfactory stimulation or tactile stimulation of the hind legs. Our results show that convergent behavioural responses to crowding have evolved employing different sites of sensory input in the Australian plague locust and the desert locust. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study examined the potential competitive interac- tions between dogs and wild scavengers on the boundary of Gokwe Communal Land (GCL) and the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area (SWRA) in 1995–96. Dietary studies showed that dogs were pri- marily scavengers of human waste and animal carcasses. Twelve experimental carcasses indicated that dogs were the most successful species in the vertebrate scavenger guild, consuming 60{\%} of avail- able biomass and ﬁnding 66.7{\%} of carcasses. Dogs monopolized the supply of domestic animal car- rion within GCL, but also consumed wild carrion up to 1 km within the SWRA, and were seen 3 km inside the reserve. Their principal competitors for carcasses were vultures, and to a lesser degree lions (Panthera leo), leopards (P. pardus) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta). Dogs outcompete vul- tures on wildlife reserve boundaries owing to their high densities, nocturnal and diurnal activity, phys- ical dominance and greater tolerance of human disturbance. With a population growth rate of 6.5{\%} per annum the inﬂuence of dogs will intensify on the peripheries of reserves, exacerbating their exist- ing threat to wild scavengers. This scenario is probably occurring in many other African countries.},

We test T-LoCoH against a simulated dataset and provide illustrative examples from a GPS dataset from springbok in Namibia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of time into home range construction expands the concept of utilization distributions beyond the traditional density gradient to spatial models of movement and time, opening the door to new applications in movement ecology.},

abstract = {An understanding of the core demographic characteristics of the sub-populations of FRD is essential to effectively implement both rabies control interventions through mass vaccination of FRD, and dog population control programmes. This study compares the data obtained following photographic sight-resight surveys in rural (Shirsuphal village in west India) and urban (Municipal Corporation Panchkula in north India) locations. A total of 263 and 1408 FRD were seen at least once through 617 and 3465 sightings in the rural and urban sites, respectively. The rural location had a lower proportion of females (OR 0.5, 95{\%} CI 0.4–0.7) and a higher proportion of poor and fair conditioned dogs (OR 1.8, 95{\%} CI 1.3–2.3) compared to the urban setting. The rural site also had fewer active FRD (OR 0.6, 95{\%} CI 0.5–0.7) and FRD were less likely to be sighted within 20 m of garbage points (OR 0.3, 95{\%} CI 0.2–0.3) compared to the urban site. The demographic composition of the FRD population was found to vary within the urban location, with the odds of sighting a de-sexed dog being significantly higher in residential areas compared to other areas. The study underlines the importance of knowing the demographic composition of FRD for implementation of effective interventions against rabies. Fewer female dogs in the rural location indicate that spaying could be an effective tool for dog population management in this setting, while presence of dogs within 20 m of garbage points in urban settings highlights that an improved garbage management may reduce the carrying capacity of the urban locality resulting in smaller FRD population. It is concluded that quick and low cost surveys can generate useful demographic data for FRD in urban and rural settings which can be useful to understand the epidemiology of rabies and its control.},

abstract = {Snakes are renowned for their ability to subdue and swallow large, often dangerous prey animals. Numerous adaptations, including constriction, venom, and a strike-and-release feeding strategy, help them avoid injury during predatory encounters. Burton's legless lizard ( Lialis burtonis Gray, Pygopodidae) has converged strongly on snakes. It is functionally limbless and feeds at infrequent intervals on relatively large prey items (other lizards) capable of inflicting a damaging bite. However, L. burtonis possesses neither venom glands, nor the ability to constrict prey. We investigated how L. burtonis subdues its prey without suffering serious retaliatory bites. Experiments showed that lizards modified their strike precision according to prey size; very large prey were always struck on the head or neck, preventing them from biting. In addition, L. burtonis delayed swallowing large lizards until they were incapacitated, whereas smaller prey were usually swallowed while still struggling. Lialis burtonis also displays morphological adaptations protecting it from prey retaliation. Its long snout prevents prey from biting, and it can retract its lidless eyes out of harm's way while holding onto a food item. The present study further clarifies the remarkable convergence between snakes and L. burtonis , and highlights the importance of prey retaliatory potential in predator evolution.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {Crocodilians have a variety of reproductive strategies. while different species have different requirements for nesting sites, most crocodilians, including the saltwater Crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) which is highly adapted to saline environments, predominantly select freshwater habitats for nesting. using the locality data of 4,537 nests observed between 2000 and 2011 in the northern territory of Australia, we examined nesting sites in relation to vegetation communities with different salinity regimes. despite potential bias in the heterogeneous distribution and abundance of the nests introduced by some anthropologic factors, the dataset covered the majority of coastal, sub-coastal, riparian, and wetland regions across the northern territory (21 catchments) and approximately 57{\%} of the vegetation communities available in these regions. within these vegetation communities, 87.7{\%} of nests (3,978 out of 4,537) were found in freshwater or hypo-saline (mild brackish) habitats (89.7{\%} of total habitat area), and 12.3{\%} (559 out of 4,537) were found in saline habitats (10.3{\%} of total habitat area). the most commonly used vegetation community was tall, closed tussock grassland with Oryza species (36.2{\%} of nests) that represented 15.5{\%} of the total habitat area. other common vegetation communities included open forest or woodland with eucalyptus, Melaleuca, and Pandanus species with tussock grassland or sedgeland ground layers. nest site selection seems to be influenced by multiple factors, including freshwater habitats being more available than saline habitats, physiological advantages of freshwater to nesting females and/or hatchlings, and the suitability of the ground layer vegetation for constructing mound-like nests. Vegetation communities may be used to assess the suitability of nesting habitat for management and conservation purposes.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that most communication occurs in the context of networks of several individuals, the consequences of considering communication as a network on individuals' capacity for gathering information on congeners has been little investigated. Eavesdropping is the behaviour of a receiver extracting information from an interaction in which it is taking no part. Due to the fact that signals used in aggressive interactions are assumed to be reliable, eavesdropping could be an effective way of evaluating the quality fo potential mates. We conducted two experiments designed to discover if female fighting fish (Betta splendens) monitor aggresive interactions between two males and if information gained by eavesdropping is used in the initial stages of subsequent mate choice. We found that females that had seen the interaction visited the winner first more often and spent significantly more time near, looking at, and displaying to the winner of the interaction. By contrast, females that had not seen the interaction visited the loser first more often and did not behave significantly differently to winner and loser. Overall, these results are consistent with the idea that in the initial stages of mate choice femals eavesdrop, ie use inforamtion gathered from male-male displays.},

abstract = {Dynamic body acceleration (DBA) has been used as a proxy for energy expenditure in logger-equipped animals, with researchers summing the acceleration (overall dynamic body acceleration--ODBA) from the three orthogonal axes of devices. The vector of the dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may be a better proxy so this study compared ODBA and VeDBA as proxies for rate of oxygen consumption using humans and 6 other species. Twenty-one humans on a treadmill ran at different speeds while equipped with two loggers, one in a straight orientation and the other skewed, while rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) was recorded. Similar data were obtained from animals but using only one (straight) logger. In humans, both ODBA and VeDBA were good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.88, although ODBA accounted for slightly but significantly more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P{\textless}0.03). There were no significant differences between ODBA and VeDBA in terms of the change in VO2 estimated by the acceleration data in a simulated situation of the logger being mounted straight but then becoming skewed (P = 0.744). In the animal study, ODBA and VeDBA were again good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.70 although, again, ODBA accounted for slightly, but significantly, more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P{\textless}0.03). The simultaneous contraction of muscles, inserted variously for limb stability, may produce muscle oxygen use that at least partially equates with summing components to derive DBA. Thus, a vectorial summation to derive DBA cannot be assumed to be the more 'correct' calculation. However, although within the limitations of our simple study, ODBA appears a marginally better proxy for VO2. In the unusual situation where researchers are unable to guarantee at least reasonably consistent device orientation, they should use VeDBA as a proxy for VO2.},

abstract = {The evolution of signals has mainly been considered in the context of an emitter–receiver dyadic interaction. However, com- munication usually occurs in the presence of individuals (an audience) that are not directly involved in the communication interaction, and it is more realistic to assume that signal evolution occurs in a network. Several types of information could be available to an audience, and, therefore, the presence of an audience could have effects on the behavior of the communicating animals and on signal evolution. We investigated whether the presence of an audience of conspecifics affected intrasexual aggressive communication in male fighting fish. We found that if the audience was a female, males increased the intensity of conspicuous displays that can be used in communication with both males and females and decreased highly aggressive displays that are solely directed to males. If the audience was a male of similar size, there was no significant change in the way in which males displayed. These results suggest that the presence of an audience could be one reason that many long-range and con- spicuous signals are often shaped to transmit information to both males and females.

abstract = {The recent development of lightweight GPS collars has enabled medium-to-small sized animals to be tracked via GPS telemetry. Evaluation of the performance and accuracy of GPS collars is largely confined to devices designed for large animals for deployment in natural environments. This study aimed to assess the performance of lightweight GPS collars within a suburban environment, which may be different from natural environments in a way that is relevant to satellite signal acquisition. We assessed the effects of vegetation complexity, sky availability (percentage of clear sky not obstructed by natural or artificial features of the environment), proximity to buildings, and satellite geometry on fix success rate (FSR) and location error (LE) for lightweight GPS collars within a suburban environment. Sky availability had the largest affect on FSR, while LE was influenced by sky availability, vegetation complexity, and HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision). Despite the complexity and modified nature of suburban areas, values for FSR (mean= 90.6{\%}) and LE (mean = 30.1 m) obtained within the suburban environment are comparable to those from previous evaluations of GPS collars designed for larger animals and within less built-up environments. Due to fine-scale patchiness of habitat within urban environments, it is recommended that resource selection methods that are not reliant on buffer sizes be utilised for selection studies.},

abstract = {Crayfish are known for their innate aggressiveness and willingness to quickly establish dominance relationships among group members. Consequently, the formation of dominance hierarchies and the analysis of behavioral patterns displayed during agonistic encounters have mostly been tested in environments that provide no immediate resources besides space. We tested the hypothesis that social hierarchy formation in crayfish serves to determine access to future resources. Individuals within groups of three juvenile crayfish were allowed to form a social hierarchy in a featureless environment before a single food resource was presented. Higher dominance indices were significantly correlated with increased access to the food. The highest ranked crayfish spent more time in contact with the food than did medium-ranked and lowest ranked crayfish, and crayfish of medium rank spent more time in contact with the resource than did lowest ranked animals. The highest ranked crayfish consolidated their dominant status in the presence of food, indicated by a complete absence of any submissive behaviors during that period. The results of these experiments show that the disposition of crayfish to engage in fighting and formation of a dominance hierarchy in a featureless environment serves to determine future access to an emerging resource, thereby entailing greater benefits for animals of higher social rank.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {The crested porcupine Hystrix cristata is a large rodent which pairs for life. We studied the space use of 17 female and 9 male radio-tracked porcupines in an evergreen coastal woodland ("macchia", EW) and in an agricultural estate (AE), with special reference to the use of cultivations. Home range sizes of male porcupines (4.72-323.40) ranged around 114. ha (median) during the warm period (April-September) and 162. ha during the cold one (October-March). Home ranges of females (2.48-323.40) were c. 91. ha during the warm period and c. 143. ha during the cold one. Habitat composition and selection changed from the cold to the warm months, with porcupines being present in agricultural areas especially in the latter. Home range overlap between members of the same pair varied from 57{\%} to 97{\%} (median, 75{\%}). Habitat selection was analyzed at the second (within study area) and at the third (within home range) order of selection. Within study areas, porcupines avoided cultivations and selected habitats with dense vegetation, providing cover and food. Within home ranges, in the warm period, porcupines selected agricultural areas in EW, where this habitat represented a minor portion of the study site. In that season, the Mediterranean "macchia" is a poor source of food, forcing porcupines to travel long distances to reach feeding sites. No significant difference of habitat selection within home ranges was detected between members of the same pair. Cultivations may play a key-role for porcupine survival, especially in poor habitats, as they provide abundant food resources in the warm period.},

abstract = {Abstract As both companion animals and opportunistic predators, dogs (Canis lupus spp.) have had a long and complex relationship with humans. In Australia, the dingo (C. l. dingo) was introduced 4,000 years ago and, other than humans, is now the continent's top mammalian predator. Domestic dogs (C. l. familiaris) were introduced by Europeans more recently and they interbreed with dingoes. This hybridization has caused growing concern about the roles that domestic dogs and dingoes play in shaping ecosystem processes. There is also considerable debate about whether anthropogenic environmental changes can alter the ecological roles of dingoes. We used scat analysis to test whether the dingo, as the longer-established predator, occupies a different dietary niche from that of free-roaming domestic dogs, irrespective of human influence. Our results demonstrate considerable dietary overlap between dingoes and domestic dogs in areas where humans provide supplementary food, providing evidence against our hypothesi...},

Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

However, the drivers and mechanisms of the species' spatial ecology remain poorly understood. Thanks to a recently developed framework, the movement ecology of any organism can now be tackled within a consistent and unified theoretical approach. * Based on this framework, we reviewed the literature on wild boar movement ecology to assess current knowledge and to identify important gaps. * By using important navigational (e.g. olfactory sense) and cognitive (e.g. spatial memory, learning from conspecifics) abilities, wild boar have developed complex movement strategies to cope with external factors. However, there is a lack of detailed information on the role played by the internal state (motivation) and motion capacity in shaping the spatial ability of the species. * Specific aspects of the movement ecology of the wild boar, together with its high diet plasticity and its high prolificacy, are probably the most important causes of the rapid spread of wild boar worldwide. * We hope our review will inspire other scientists to apply their biological models to the movement ecology paradigms. Furthermore, we suggest that future researchers dealing with the movement ecology of any species should explicitly state the components and interactions of the framework investigated to facilitate further understanding and comparison among studies.},

abstract = {Current knowledge about terrestrial vertebrates that kill and eat other terrestrial vertebrates in the Oriental Region is summarised. Carnivory, by this defi nition, is dominated by snakes, diurnal and nocturnal birds of prey, and members of the order Carnivora, although a wide range of other Oriental vertebrates eat at least some vertebrate prey. The most species-rich lowland forest sites can support at least 45–65 carnivorous vertebrates, which appear to partition prey by type, size, period of activity and spatial distribution, although there are also many species with apparently generalist diets. Most prey types are taken by reptilian, avian and mammalian carnivores, but, except on islands, the largest prey are taken only by the largest mammalian carnivores. Most carnivores take some prey near their own body mass, with the exceptions being mostly specialists on ectotherms or rodents, or omnivores that also consume invertebrates and/or plant foods. Oriental forests support more sympatric mammalian carnivores than anywhere else in the tropics, but fewer snakes and birds than the Neotropics, and apparently fewer sympatric vertebrate carnivores overall. The tiger is the world's largest tropical forest carnivore and the biggest Asian pythons are the largest dryland snakes, but the Region lacks a really large raptor, except in the Philippines. Hunting is the biggest threat to most mammalian carnivores and is often driven by trade, while habitat loss and degradation are the major threats to birds. Introductions from outside the Region are not yet a problem, but translocations of Oriental species to islands may have already had signifi cant impacts. Maintaining intact communities of large carnivores will require protected areas that are much larger and much better protected than most that exist at present. The major research needs are ecological studies of entire carnivore communities at the few sites where these are still intact and conservation-oriented studies of threatened species},

abstract = {We radio-tracked a pack of bush dogs Speothos venaticus (7-10 individuals) near Agua Boa in Mato Grosso, Brazil, for 18 months to investigate their use of habitat in cultivated land. The pack's home range was 709 km(2) (fixed-kernel 95{\%}), which exceeds estimates of home range for the largest Neotropical carnivore, the jaguar Panthera onca. Of the 245 locations where the dogs were recorded 95{\%} were within native vegetation (savannah and forest), even though these habitats comprised only 34{\%} of the pack's home range. This indicates a preference for native vegetation, and this was reinforced by composition analysis of habitat use, which showed that the pack used savannah and forest more than expected and cultivated areas less than expected. Analysis of activity showed that the bush dogs were moving quickly in more than half of the locations in cultivated areas, foraging in most savannah locations and resting in most forest locations. Our results indicate that bush dogs can live in areas with a high proportion of cultivated land (66{\%}), possibly because of the structural connectivity of the landscape (80{\%} of the native habitat is within a single patch). However, their home range appears to be inflated compared to that of other carnivores, which may have a negative effect on the species in the long term.},

abstract = {Tactile stimuli provide animals with important information about the environment, including physical features such as obstacles, and biologically relevant cues related to food, mates, hosts and predators. The antennae, the principal sensory organs of insects, house an array of sensory receptors for olfaction, gustation, audition, nociception, balance, stability, graviception, static electric fields, and thermo-, hygro- and mechanoreception. The antennae, being the anteriormost sensory appendages, play a prominent role in social interactions with conspecifics that involve primarily chemosensory and tactile stimuli. In the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) antennal contact during social interactions modulates brain-regulated juvenile hormone production, ultimately accelerating the reproductive rate in females. The primary sensory modality mediating this social facilitation of reproduction is antennal mechanoreception. We investigated the key elements, or stimulus features, of antennal contact that socially facilitate reproduction in B. germanica females. Using motor-driven antenna mimics, we assessed the physiological responses of females to artificial tactile stimulation. Our results indicate that tactile stimulation with artificial materials, some deviating significantly from the native antennal morphology, can facilitate female reproduction. However, none of the artificial stimuli matched the effects of social interactions with a conspecific female.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in the role that apex predators play in shaping terrestrial ecosystems and maintaining trophic cascades. In line with the mesopredator release hypothesis, Australian dingoes (Canis lupus dingo and hybrids) are assumed by many to regulate the abundance of invasive mesopredators, such as red foxes Vulpes vulpes and feral cats Felis catus, thereby providing indirect benefits to various threatened vertebrates. Several recent papers have claimed to provide evidence for the bio-diversity benefits of dingoes in this way. Nevertheless, in this paper we highlight several critical weaknesses in the methodological approaches used in many of these reports, including lack of consideration for seasonal and habitat differences in activity, the complication of simple track-based indices by incorporating difficult-to-meet assumptions, and a reduction in sensitivity for assessing populations by using binary measures rather than potentially continuous measures. Of the 20 studies reviewed, 15 of them (75{\%}) contained serious methodological flaws, which may partly explain the inconclusive nature of the literature investigating interactions between invasive Australian predators. We therefore assert that most of the "growing body of evidence" for mesopredator release is merely an inconclusive growing body of literature only. We encourage those interested in studying the ecological roles of dingoes relative to invasive mesopredators and native prey species to account for the factors we identify, and caution the value of studies that have not done so [Current Zoology 57 (5): 568-583, 2011].},

abstract = {Urban free-roaming dog populations in the developing world are managed by a patchwork of local veterinary practitioners, government programs, and non-governmental organizations with varied effectiveness. While lethal removal is still commonly practiced, vaccination and fertility control methods are increasingly being adopted. Identifying which method(s) provides the most cost effective management is needed to inform dog population managers who seek to limit conflicts like dog bites, the spread of disease, and predation on wildlife. Here we describe an agent-based model that simulates the population of free-roaming dogs in Jaipur, a northwestern Indian city. We then apply various lethal and fertility control methodologies to identify which most effectively lowered the dog population size. This spatially explicit model includes temporal and demographic details of street dog populations modeled after data from the study city. We tested each pairing of control type (lethal or fertility) with search method (how to target efforts) to see their efficacy at altering the city's dog population size, age structure, sterilization coverage, as well as the number of dogs handled. Models were run for 15 years to assess the long term effects of intervention. We found that the fertility control method that targets areas of the city with the highest percentage of intact bitches outperforms all other fertility control and lethal removal programs at reducing the population size while sterilizing a significantly higher proportion of the population. All lethal program methods skewed population demographics towards significantly younger dogs, thus likely increasing the frequency of conflict with humans. This work demonstrates the benefits of modeling differing management policies in free-roaming dogs.},

However, quantitative information on the effects of dogs on saiga is lacking. In August 2008 and April 2009, we estimated abundance of dogs in Sharga Nature Reserve by compiling existing data and interviewing local people to understand public perceptions regarding impacts of dogs on saiga. Interviews revealed that the majority of local herders believed dogs have only a minor impact on saiga due to the low density of domestic dogs and the lack of feral dogs in the reserve. However, dogs are believed to have greater impacts on saiga in harsh winters, when saiga are in poorer health and are more likely to use areas where dogs are present. Thus, domestic dogs in the study area appear to have no regular detrimental impact on the local saiga population, but may act as a source of additive mortality in years},

Solitarious (isolated-reared) females produce relatively small eggs that yield solitarious green hatchlings but, females that are exposed to crowded conditions during the sensitive period, produce larger eggs that yield the dark-colored hatchlings characteristic of gregarious forms. The present study aimed to determine the stimuli influencing the maternal determination of progeny characteristics as well as the site at which such stimuli are perceived. By exposing isolated female adults to various combinations of visual, olfactory and tactile stimuli from a crowd of other adults, we found that no crowding effects could be elicited without tactile stimulation. Coating of various body surfaces with nail polish followed by exposure to crowding stimulation suggested that female adults perceive crowding stimuli with their antennae. This finding was supported by another experiment in which the antennae were either removed or covered with wax before the isolated females were exposed to crowded conditions. Neither serotonin nor an antagonist of its receptor affected the density-dependent maternal determination of progeny characteristics when injected into isolated or crowded female adults. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Bi-weekly surveys of seven study sites were conducted between August 2006 and September 2007. We analyzed 484 coyote scats. The top five prey types consumed by the coyotes studied were small mammals (84.71{\%}), herbaceous plants (44.63{\%}), crabapples (33.88{\%}), woody plants (16.94{\%}) and anthropogenic food sources (14.05{\%}). Domestic animals – cats (Felis catus) and dogs (Canis familiaris) – were found in 6 scats (1.24{\%} of all scats sampled). Large parks had the greatest amount of scats containing native berries ($\chi$ 2 6 =1700, p{\textless}0.001) while smaller parks had higher levels of crabapples ($\chi$ 2 6 =3700, p{\textless}0.001) and anthropogenic content ($\chi$ 2 6 =413.4, p{\textless}0.001) in scats. Scats containing domestic animals were relatively few, highly localized and occurred primarily in the Calgary neighbourhood with the most frequent reports of aggression/predation behaviour in coyotes. Herbaceous plants ($\chi$ 2 2 =89.273, p{\textless}0.001), crabapples ($\chi$ 2 2 =5023, p{\textless}0.001) small mammals ($\chi$ 2 2 =755.3, p{\textless}0.001) and anthropogenic food sources ($\chi$ 2 2 =183.9, p{\textless}0.001) were all consumed most during the Dispersal season. Woody plants ($\chi$ 2 2 =998.0, p{\textless}0.001) were consumed significantly more during Pup-Rearing. Coyotes in Calgary consume predominantly natural prey items. However, the presence of anthropogenic food items in 14{\%} of scats suggests heightened risk of food conditioning, a potential for habituation to humans, which can increase human-coyote conflict.

abstract = {The detection of stress arising from parasitic infection by Sarcoptes scabieis and from pregnancy is explored, using a fractal analysis of head lifting behaviour and feeding-non-feeding activity sequences in female Spanish ibex, Capra pyrenaica, under natural conditions. Because organisms under stress increase their metabolic rate and, in consequence, energy consumption, it follows that stress will, generally, lead to a reduction in complexity (fractal dimension) of exploratory behaviour. In the present study the fractal dimension of the three measures of complexity used declined with stress, both from pregnancy and from parasitic infection. This observation provides a new and effective way to assess the general state of animals' health in the field, without the need for capture and handling. {\textcopyright} 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},
